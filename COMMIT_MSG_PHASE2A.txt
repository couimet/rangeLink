feat(monorepo): phase 2A complete - workspace setup with pnpm

Successfully transformed single-package project into monorepo structure.
All 114 tests passing, compilation working, ready for Phase 2B.

CHANGES:

1. Workspace Structure
   - Created packages/rangelink-vscode-extension/ directory
   - Moved src/, jest.config.js, tsconfig.json to extension package
   - All source files remain unchanged (structure-only refactor)

2. Workspace Configuration
   - Created pnpm-workspace.yaml for workspace management
   - Created tsconfig.base.json for shared TypeScript configuration
   - Packages can now extend base config for consistency

3. Package Separation
   - Root package.json: Workspace orchestration (pnpm -r commands)
   - Extension package.json: VSCode-specific metadata and scripts
   - Clean separation: build/test/lint run across all packages

4. Build & Test Validation
   - ✅ pnpm install: Workspace dependencies resolved
   - ✅ pnpm compile: TypeScript compilation successful
   - ✅ pnpm test: 114 passing, 3 skipped (same as before)
   - ✅ Output: Compiled to packages/rangelink-vscode-extension/out/

5. Configuration Updates
   - .gitignore: Added monorepo artifacts (packages/*/out/, *.tsbuildinfo)
   - Extension tsconfig: Extends ../../tsconfig.base.json
   - Extension README: Points to main docs, dev instructions

SUCCESS CRITERIA - ALL MET:
✅ Structure matches target design
✅ Compilation works without errors
✅ All tests pass (114 passing, 3 skipped)
✅ Git shows clean renames and new files
✅ Ready for Phase 2B (core library extraction)

TIME: 15 minutes (under 1 hour estimate)

SCOPE (Phase 2A):
✅ Directory restructuring
✅ Workspace configuration  
✅ Path updates in config files
✅ Verification of existing functionality

OUT OF SCOPE (Phase 2A):
❌ No core library extraction (that's Phase 2B)
❌ No code logic changes
❌ No new packages created
❌ No CI/CD setup

NEXT STEPS:
- Phase 2B: Extract rangelink-core-ts package
- Phase 2C: Refactor VSCode extension to use core
- Phase 2D: Create Neovim plugin shell
- Phase 2E: Add CI/CD pipeline

  package.json (root → workspace orchestration)
  pnpm-workspace.yaml (NEW)
  tsconfig.base.json (NEW)
