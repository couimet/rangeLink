## Why RangeLink?

Every AI coding assistant has its own way to share code — different shortcuts, different formats, different muscle memory. If you use multiple AI tools, you're constantly context-switching.

**RangeLink unifies it:**

- **One keybinding** — `Cmd+R Cmd+L` works with Claude, Copilot, Cursor, terminal tools, text editors. Learn once, use everywhere.
- **Better precision** — Character-level ranges, not just lines. Share exactly what matters.
- **Universal format** — GitHub-style links work in PRs, Slack, docs. Not proprietary.
- **AI-agnostic** — Your workflow doesn't change when you switch AI assistants.

### For AI-Assisted Development

**Using Claude Code Extension, terminal claude-code, ChatGPT, or Cursor for development?** RangeLink eliminates the context-sharing friction:

1. **Select code** → Generate link (`Cmd+R Cmd+L`)
2. **Destination handles delivery** → Link appears where your AI can see it
3. **AI reads precise context** → No manual copy/paste, no lost focus
4. **AI responds with links** → **Click to jump directly to code** (Cmd+Click in terminal or editor)

**Compete with built-in AI features** by making external AI assistants feel integrated. You get:

- ⚡ **Zero-friction AI context** — Destinations auto-send links. No clipboard juggling.
- 🎯 **Choice of AI model** — Claude, GPT, Gemini, anything. Not locked into one vendor.
- 📐 **Full control over context** — Character-level precision (`#L42C10`), not just line-level.
- 🔗 **Cross-file context** — Generate links from multiple files, paste all in one prompt.
- 🌐 **Universal compatibility** — Works across editors (VSCode, Cursor) and in any text-based tool.

### Perfect For

- 🤖 **AI assistants** — Claude Code Extension, Cursor AI, terminal claude-code, Copilot with _exact_ context + clickable navigation
- 💬 **Code reviews** — "The bug is in `api/routes.ts#L215C8-L223C45`" (click to view)
- 👥 **Team collaboration** — Universal format everyone can use and navigate

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Open VSCode or Cursor
2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "RangeLink"
4. Click Install

### Basic Usage

1. **Select text** in the editor (non-empty selection required)
2. **Press `Cmd+R Cmd+L`** (Mac) or `Ctrl+R Ctrl+L` (Windows/Linux)
3. Link copied to clipboard!

**Example output:**

```
recipes/baking/chickenpie.ts#L3C14-L15C9
```

**Note:** `R` then `L` - the letters stand for **R**ange **L**ink.

## Features

### 🎯 Destinations

**The killer feature for AI-assisted workflows:** Auto-send generated links to your preferred destination.

**RangeLink's unified pattern:** All destinations share the same seamless workflow—links paste exactly at your insertion point, the destination auto-focuses, and you immediately continue typing. No copy/paste friction, no manual clicking, no context switching. This is what makes RangeLink competitive with integrated AI assistants like Cursor's `Cmd+L`, but works across any destination and any AI.

**Send more than links:**

- `Cmd+R Cmd+V` — Paste your selection as-is (perfect for quick code snippets)
- `Cmd+R Cmd+F` — Paste current file's path (`Shift` for absolute)

No destination bound? A quick pick menu appears so you can choose and bind in one action.

**Pro tip:** Power users rebind destinations on the fly. Working with Claude Code? Bind there. Switching to debug in terminal? Rebind with a right-click. Your workflow, your rules.

#### Terminal

Bind a terminal to RangeLink, and all generated links auto-paste directly there — even if you switch to other terminals for work.

**Perfect for terminal-based AI workflows (claude-code CLI):** Links paste **exactly at your insertion point** in the terminal (not appended at the end), **and the terminal auto-focuses** so you can immediately continue typing your prompt.

**How to use:**

1. Open integrated terminal
2. Bind using either:
   - **Command Palette** → "Bind to Terminal" → **pick from your open terminals**
   - **Right-click terminal tab** or **right-click inside terminal** → "RangeLink: Bind Here"
   - **RangeLink Menu** (`Cmd+R Cmd+M`) → select a terminal from the inline list
3. Select code → Generate link → Link pastes **at insertion point** + **terminal focuses automatically**

**Terminal Picker:** When binding via Command Palette or RangeLink Menu, a QuickPick shows your eligible terminals. The currently bound terminal is marked "bound" and sorted first, followed by the active terminal marked "active". When a terminal is both bound and active, it shows "bound · active". With many terminals, extras collapse into "More terminals..." (configurable via `rangelink.terminalPicker.maxInline`) — the bound terminal is always visible, never hidden behind the overflow.

#### Text Editor

**Build AI prompts in any text document before sending to your AI assistant?** Bind any text editor as your destination—works with untitled files, markdown, code files, notes, anything text-based.

**Perfect for complex prompts:** Links paste **exactly at your insertion point** in the bound editor, **and the editor auto-focuses** so you can immediately continue typing.

**How to use:**

1. Open a scratchpad file: untitled (`Cmd+N` / `Ctrl+N`) or any text file
2. Bind using either:
   - **Command Palette** → "Bind to Text Editor"
   - **Right-click inside editor** → "RangeLink: Bind Here"
3. Select code in another file → Generate links → They paste **at insertion point** + **editor focuses automatically**

**Workflow:**

- **Draft complex prompts** - Gather multiple code references in one place (any file type)
- **Review context** - See all links together, validate navigation (Cmd+Click to test)
- **Iterate on prompts** - Edit, rearrange, add notes around links before sending to AI

**Requirements:**

- **Writable text files only** - Binary files (images, PDFs) and read-only views (git diffs, output panels) are blocked
- **Different source and destination** - If you try to paste to the same file you're selecting from, RangeLink copies to clipboard and shows a message (use R-C for intentional clipboard-only links)

When you close the bound file, RangeLink auto-unbinds with a notification. If the bound file is hidden behind other tabs, RangeLink automatically brings it to the foreground during paste.

**File Picker** <sup>Unreleased</sup>: In the destination picker and RangeLink Menu, open text editor files appear as individual items. The active (frontmost) file per tab group is shown inline; if you have more open files, they collapse into "More files..." which opens a secondary picker organized into "Active Files" and per-"Tab Group N" sections. The currently bound file is marked "bound" and sorted to the top.

**Pro tip:** Split your editor into two panes (side-by-side or vertical) for the smoothest workflow — browse code on one side, build your prompt on the other. No tab switching needed.

#### AI Assistants (Claude Code, Cursor AI & GitHub Copilot)

**One keybinding to rule them all.** AI assistants have their own ways to share code — different shortcuts, different formats, and only work with _their_ AI. RangeLink unifies it all: **one keybinding** (`Cmd+R Cmd+L`), **character-level precision** (not just lines), and works with **any AI assistant**.

**The precision advantage:** Most AI code-sharing tools work at _line-level_ precision. RangeLink goes deeper with _character-level_ ranges (`#L3C14-L15C9`), letting you highlight exactly the function signature, the problematic condition, or that one sneaky semicolon — not the whole block.

**Supported AI assistants:**

- **[Claude Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code)** — Anthropic's official extension (works in VSCode and Cursor)
- **Cursor AI** — Built into Cursor IDE
- **[GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)** — GitHub's AI coding assistant

**How it works:**

1. Bind your AI assistant: Command Palette → "Bind to..."
2. Select code → `Cmd+R Cmd+L` → Link auto-pastes into chat
3. Review and send

**One destination at a time:** Bind to Claude Code, Cursor AI, terminal, OR text editor. **Quick switching:** Run a different "Bind to..." command to replace your current binding with confirmation—no need to unbind first.

### 🖱️ Link Navigation

**Click RangeLinks anywhere to jump directly to code** — the perfect complement to destinations.

#### Terminal Navigation

Any RangeLink in your terminal becomes clickable — whether from claude-code responses, your own links you're validating before sending, or references shared by teammates:

- **Cmd+Click** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Click** (Windows/Linux) to navigate
- **Instant file opening** with precise caret positioning
- **Works with all formats:** single-line, ranges, columns, rectangular selections
- **Smart path resolution:** workspace-relative and absolute paths supported

**Example:** AI suggests checking `recipes/baking/chickenpie.ts#L3C14-L15C9` → Click → VSCode opens file at exact selection.

#### Editor Navigation

RangeLinks in editor files (markdown, text, code, untitled) are also clickable:

- **Hover** to see navigation details
- **Cmd+Click** to jump to code
- **Perfect for scratchpads** - Validate links before sending to claude-code

#### Go to Link <sup>Unreleased</sup>

**Have a RangeLink but no clickable context?** Paste or type it directly:

- **Press `Cmd+R Cmd+G`** (Mac) or **`Ctrl+R Ctrl+G`** (Windows/Linux)
- **Supports all link formats:** full paths, ranges, columns (e.g., `recipes/baking/chickenpie.ts#L3C14-L15C9`)
- **Jump instantly** to that exact code location

**Perfect for:** Links from Slack, email, documentation, or AI responses you can't click directly.

### 🔗 Flexible Link Formats

- **Single line:** `recipes/baking/chickenpie.ts#L42`
- **Line ranges:** `recipes/baking/chickenpie.ts#L10-L25`
- **Column precision:** `recipes/baking/chickenpie.ts#L3C14-L15C9`
- **Rectangular selections:** `recipes/baking/chickenpie.ts##L10C5-L20C10` (double hash)

### 📦 Portable Links (BYOD)

Share code references with teammates who use different delimiter configurations. Portable links embed metadata so they work everywhere — no coordination needed.

```text
path#L10C5-L20C10~#~L~-~C~
```

The `~` separator marks embedded delimiters that override recipient's local settings. No coordination needed — links just work.

#### Terminal-Aware Keybindings <sup>Unreleased</sup>

When the terminal has focus with text selected, R-V sends the terminal selection to your bound destination. Other R-keybindings (R-L, R-C) gracefully guide you back to R-V instead of silently doing nothing.

| Keybinding                     | Shortcut (Mac) | Shortcut (Win/Linux) | Description                                           |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Paste Terminal Selection (R-V) | `Cmd+R Cmd+V`  | `Ctrl+R Ctrl+V`      | Copy terminal selection and send to bound destination |

**Customizing Shortcuts:** Press `Cmd+K Cmd+S` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K Ctrl+S` (Win/Linux) to open Keyboard Shortcuts, then search for "RangeLink".

- All delimiters must be unique
- Reserved characters (`~`, `|`, `/`, `\`, `:`, `,`, `@`) cannot be used

Invalid configurations will fall back to defaults with a warning in the output channel (`Cmd+Shift+U` / `Ctrl+Shift+U`, select "RangeLink"). See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md#development-workflow) for details.

### Warning Settings <sup>Unreleased</sup>

| Setting                       | Default | Description                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rangelink.warnOnDirtyBuffer` | `true`  | Show warning when generating a link from a file with unsaved changes |

When enabled, a dialog appears with options: "Save & Generate", "Generate Anyway", or dismiss to abort. This helps avoid creating links that may point to incorrect positions after the file is saved.

### Terminal Picker Settings <sup>Unreleased</sup>

| Setting                              | Default | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `rangelink.terminalPicker.maxInline` | `5`     | Maximum terminals shown inline in picker (extras in "More terminals...") |

When you have more terminals than this threshold, the destination picker shows a "More terminals..." option instead of listing all terminals individually.

### Smart Padding Settings <sup>Unreleased</sup>

| Setting                                | Default  | Description                               |
| -------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `rangelink.smartPadding.pasteLink`     | `"both"` | Padding around generated RangeLinks (R-L) |
| `rangelink.smartPadding.pasteContent`  | `"none"` | Padding around selected text (R-V)        |
| `rangelink.smartPadding.pasteFilePath` | `"both"` | Padding around file paths (R-F)           |

<!-- TODO: #366 unhide when bookmarks graduates from beta — re-add this row to the Smart Padding table above
| `rangelink.smartPadding.pasteBookmark` | `"both"` | Padding around saved bookmarks            |
-->

**Available values:** `"both"` (space before and after), `"before"` (space before only), `"after"` (space after only), `"none"` (no padding).

Most paste commands default to `"both"` to prevent the pasted text from concatenating with surrounding content. The exception is `pasteContent` which defaults to `"none"` — selected text is pasted exactly as-is since it typically represents raw code or prose where extra whitespace would be unwanted.

## About

RangeLink is a monorepo project with:

- **rangelink-vscode-extension** - This VSCode extension (you are here)
- **rangelink-core-ts** - Pure TypeScript core library (platform-agnostic)
- **More plugins coming** - Neovim, Sublime Text, and more

The extension is a thin wrapper around the core library, ensuring consistent behavior across all editor integrations.
