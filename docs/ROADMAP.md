# RangeLink Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for RangeLink across all packages (core library, VSCode extension, and future plugins).

> **Development Approach:** We use **micro-iterations** (1-2 hours each) to prevent feature creep and maintain momentum. Each iteration has clear scope, time estimates, and "done when" criteria. This allows for frequent commits, easy progress tracking, and natural stopping points.

## Development Principles

Our roadmap follows these core principles to ensure sustainable, high-quality development:

1. **Micro-Iterations (1-2 hours max)**
   - Each iteration is small enough to complete in one focused session
   - Clear "done when" criteria prevent scope creep
   - Time estimates help with planning and prioritization

2. **One Focus Per Iteration**
   - Feature work and refactoring are separate iterations
   - Never mix unrelated changes in a single iteration
   - Keeps commits clean and reviewable

3. **Commit Early, Commit Often**
   - Commit after each micro-iteration, even if incomplete
   - Use `[WIP]` or `[PARTIAL]` tags when appropriate
   - Git history reflects incremental progress

4. **Explicit Scope Definition**
   - Document what IS and IS NOT in scope upfront
   - Prevents "just one more thing" syndrome
   - Makes it easy to defer work to next iteration

5. **Test-Driven Quality**
   - Aim for 100% branch coverage
   - Write tests during iteration, not after
   - Skipped tests are documented with tracking issues

---

## Phase 1: Core Enhancements — ✅ Mostly Complete

Phase 1 is split into three iterative sub-phases focusing on rectangular mode support, robust delimiter validation, and portable link generation. Each sub-phase uses micro-iterations for focused, incremental progress.

**Overall Status:**

- ✅ 1A: Rectangular Mode format (double hash) - Complete
- ✅ 1B: Reserved character validation and delimiter constraints - Complete
- 🔨 1C: Portable link (BYOD) generation - Complete; parsing in progress
- 📦 Major refactoring: Test modernization with ES6 imports and TypeScript types - Complete

### 1A) Rectangular Mode Format (Double Hash) — ✅ Completed

**Objective:** Use double `delimHash` to indicate rectangular mode selections in a delimiter-agnostic way.

**Implementation:**

- Detects rectangular mode: multiple selections with identical character ranges across consecutive lines
- Format: `path##L10C5-L20C10` (double hash indicates rectangular mode)
- Works with any `delimHash` value (single or multi-character)
- Example: if `delimHash="##"`, rectangular mode uses `####` (4 hash characters)

**Test Coverage Achieved:**

- ✅ Default delimiters, custom single-character, and multi-character delimiters
- ✅ Edge cases: line 0, column 0, large numbers, min/max selections
- ✅ Negative cases: non-consecutive lines, different ranges, single selection
- ✅ Path handling: relative and absolute paths

**Future Compatibility:**

- Scales to multi-range rectangular mode: `path##L10C5-L20C10,L30C5-L40C10`
- Circular ranges are mutually exclusive with rectangular mode (circular takes precedence)

---

### 1B) Reserved Character Validation and Delimiter Constraints — ✅ Completed

**Objective:** Enforce strict validation rules to prevent parsing ambiguities and ensure forward compatibility.

**Reserved Characters** (cannot be used in delimiter configurations):

- `~` - Portable link metadata separator (BYOD format)
- `|` - Reserved for future expansion
- `/`, `\` - File path separators
- `:` - Single-line reference format (`path:42`)
- Whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) - Would break parsing
- `,` - Reserved for multi-range separator: `path#L10-L20,L30-L40`
- `@` - Reserved for circular/radius selection: `path#L10C5@15`

**Core Validation Rules:**

1. **Delimiters cannot be empty**
2. **Delimiters cannot contain digits** - Critical: ensures numeric tokens (line numbers, column positions, radius values) always parse with priority over delimiter matching
3. **All delimiters must be unique** - No two delimiters can be identical
4. **No subset/superset relationships** - A delimiter cannot be a substring of another delimiter

For detailed validation rules and implementation details, see [ERROR-HANDLING.md](./ERROR-HANDLING.md).

**Implementation:**

- Structured logging with stable error codes for each validation failure
- Aggregated error reporting: all issues shown at once, then defaults applied
- INFO log when defaults are used (`MSG_1002`)
- Defensive guard for unexpected validation states

For logging details, see [LOGGING.md](./LOGGING.md).

**Test Coverage Achieved:**

- Each reserved character across all four delimiters
- Digits, empty values, and whitespace detection
- Uniqueness and substring conflicts (start, end, middle)
- Aggregated errors when multiple problems occur simultaneously
- Confirmation that defaults are used and logged via INFO when config is invalid

---

### 1C) Portable Link (BYOD/BYODELI 🥪) Generation and Parsing — 🔨 Generation Complete, Parsing in Progress

**Objective:** Generate and parse links with embedded delimiter metadata so teams can share code references seamlessly regardless of delimiter configurations.

For comprehensive BYOD documentation, see [BYOD.md](./BYOD.md).

**Status (Micro-Iteration Approach):**

- ✅ **Generation: Complete** (commands, keybindings, context menu, metadata composition)
- ✅ **Single-character hash validation**: Enforced for user configuration
- ✅ **Test suite modernization**: ES6 imports, proper TypeScript types, 114 passing tests
- 📋 **Parsing** (broken into focused micro-iterations):
  - 📋 **1C.1** (1.5h): Parse metadata structure, extract delimiters, format validation
  - 📋 **1C.2** (1.5h): Validate extracted delimiters (reserved chars, digits, conflicts)
  - 📋 **1C.3** (2h): Recovery logic (missing delimiters, fallbacks, error UI)
  - 📋 **1C.4** (1h): Rectangular mode detection with custom BYOD hash
  - 📋 **1C.5** (30m): Documentation and cleanup
- 📋 **Navigation: Planned** (Phase 3)

**Micro-Iteration Benefits:**

- Each iteration is 1-2 hours (completable in one session)
- Clear scope and stopping points prevent feature creep
- Can commit after each micro-iteration
- Easy to track progress and estimate remaining work

**Format:**

- Line-only: `path#L10-L20~#~L~-~`
- With columns: `path#L10C5-L20C10~#~L~-~C~`
- Rectangular Mode: `path##L10C5-L20C10~#~L~-~C~` (note double hash in range part)

For detailed format specifications, see [LINK-FORMATS.md](./LINK-FORMATS.md) and [BYOD.md](./BYOD.md).

**Exposure:**

- Command: "RangeLink: Create Portable Link"
- Context menu: "Copy Portable RangeLink"
- Keybinding: `Cmd+R Cmd+P` / `Ctrl+R Ctrl+P` (two-key chord)

---

## Phase 2: Core Architecture and Monorepo — ✅ Complete

### 3I) GitHub Social Preview Banner (45 minutes) — 📋 Optional Polish

**Goal:** Create custom social preview image for better link sharing on social media, messaging apps, and GitHub.

**Background:**
When someone shares your GitHub repo link on SMS, WhatsApp, Slack, Twitter, etc., GitHub generates a preview card. By default, it uses a generic layout. A custom banner makes your project stand out and drives more clicks/installs.

**Tasks:**
- Design 1280×640px banner image featuring:
  - RangeLink logo (your chicken + BYODELI badge)
  - Project tagline: "Share Code Across Editors & Tools"
  - Example code reference: `#L3C14-L314C16` (Pi reference)
  - Visual elements: Code snippet background, subtle tech aesthetic
  - Color palette: Orange (#FF6B35), cream/beige, with dark/light versions for contrast
- Upload to GitHub: Repo Settings → General → Social preview
- Test the preview by sharing repo link in messaging apps

**Banner Description/Content Suggestions:**

Option A - Clean & Professional:
```
Top: RangeLink logo (centered or left-aligned)
Middle: Large tagline "Share Precise Code References"
Bottom: Example link "src/auth.ts#L3C14-L314C16" in monospace font
Background: Subtle gradient (cream to orange) or code snippet texture
```

Option B - Developer-Focused:
```
Left 40%: Large RangeLink logo + BYODELI badge
Right 60%:
  - "RangeLink" title
  - "Cross-editor code references"
  - Example: path#L3C14-L314C16
  - Small icons: VSCode + Cursor + GitHub logos
Background: Dark theme with syntax-highlighted code snippet
```

Option C - Minimal Hero:
```
Centered composition:
  - RangeLink logo (large, 200px)
  - "Share Code References That Just Work"
  - "#L3C14-L314C16" in highlighted badge
Background: Two-tone split (orange left, cream right) or solid with overlay
```

**Design Tools:**
- Figma (recommended for precise control)
- Canva (templates available, easier)
- Shopp-E + Photoshop (AI-generated base + manual composition)
- GitHub's own social preview generator (basic)

**Testing:**
After uploading, test by:
1. Sharing repo link in Slack/Discord (preview should show your banner)
2. Using Twitter Card Validator: https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator
3. Using Facebook Debugger: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
4. Checking on mobile (SMS preview)

**Resources & References:**
- GitHub guide: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/customizing-your-repositorys-social-media-preview
- Recommended size: 1280×640px (2:1 ratio)
- File size: Under 1MB (PNG or JPG)
- Repository topics to highlight: vscode-extension, developer-tools, productivity, code-navigation, ai-tools

**Banner Copy/Text Elements:**

**Primary headline options:**
- "Share Code Across Editors & Tools"
- "Precise Code References for Developers"
- "Cross-Editor Code Sharing Made Easy"
- "From VSCode to Claude Code - Links That Just Work"

**Supporting text:**
- "GitHub-style notation • Portable links • AI-ready"
- "Works with VSCode, Cursor, Claude Code & more"
- "Perfect for documentation, code reviews, and AI prompts"

**Call to action (optional):**
- "Available on VSCode Marketplace"
- "Install Extension →"

**Done when:** Banner uploaded to GitHub, preview tested and looks professional across platforms

### 3J) Fix README Logo Display in Installed Extension — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Make the RangeLink logo display in the installed extension's README view for fully offline functionality.

**Problem:** VS Code's extension view doesn't render markdown images with relative paths (`./icon.png`) when displaying the README in the installed extension details panel. The image works on GitHub but not in the local extension view.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ `icon.png` (35KB) exists in package root
- ✅ `package.json` correctly specifies `"icon": "icon.png"` (this shows in marketplace listing)
- ✅ `.vscodeignore` explicitly includes `icon.png` in packaged extension
- ⚠️ README line 4 uses relative path: `<img src="./icon.png" alt="RangeLink Logo" width="128" />`

**Solution: Base64 Data URI Embedding**

Convert the icon to base64 and embed directly in the README markdown. This makes the README fully self-contained and works offline without any network requests.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Generate base64 encoding of `icon.png`:
   ```bash
   base64 -i icon.png | tr -d '\n' > /tmp/icon_base64.txt
   ```

2. Create data URI format:
   ```bash
   echo -n "data:image/png;base64," > /tmp/data_uri.txt
   cat /tmp/icon_base64.txt >> /tmp/data_uri.txt
   ```

3. Update README.md line 4:
   ```markdown
   <img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS..." alt="RangeLink Logo" width="128" />
   ```

**Testing:**
- [ ] Logo displays in installed extension view (Extensions → RangeLink → Details)
- [ ] Logo still displays on GitHub repository
- [ ] Logo displays in VS Code marketplace listing
- [ ] Logo displays in Cursor marketplace listing

**Tradeoffs:**
- **Pros:** Works completely offline, no external dependencies, single source of truth
- **Cons:** Adds ~48KB to README file size (base64 encoding inflates by ~33%)

**Alternative Considered (Rejected):**
- Using absolute GitHub URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couimet/rangelink/main/packages/rangelink-vscode-extension/icon.png`
- **Rejected because:** Requires internet connection, fails for users without network access

**Done when:** Logo displays correctly in all contexts (installed extension, GitHub, marketplace), README is fully self-contained

### Time Summary

| Task | Estimate | Cumulative |
|------|----------|------------|
| Icon/logo | 1h | 1h |
| CHANGELOG | 20m | 1h 20m |
| Publisher account | 30m | 1h 50m |
| Testing | 45m | 2h 35m |
| Metadata check | 15m | 2h 50m |
| Package | 10m | 3h |
| Publish | 20m | 3h 20m |
| Post-launch | 30m | 3h 50m |
| **GitHub social banner (optional)** | **45m** | **4h 35m** |

**Total:** ~4 hours for launch (up to 4.5 hours with optional banner)

---

#### 4F) Logo Display Fix in Installed Extension — ✅ Complete

**Goal:** Make the RangeLink logo display in the installed extension's README view.

**Problem:** VS Code's extension view doesn't render markdown images with relative paths (`./icon.png`) in the installed extension details panel. Works on GitHub but not locally.

**Solution:** Use GitHub raw content URL instead of relative path or data URI. This works everywhere (marketplace, GitHub, installed extensions) and gracefully falls back to alt text when offline.

**Tasks:**

- ✅ Update extension README to use GitHub raw content URL
- ✅ Logo displays on GitHub and VS Code marketplace

**Tradeoffs:**

- **Pro:** Clean solution, no bloat, works in all online contexts
- **Pro:** Falls back to alt text when offline
- **Con:** Requires internet connection to display logo

**Deliverables:**

- ✅ GitHub raw URL in extension README: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couimet/rangelink/main/icon.png`
- ✅ Logo displays across marketplace, GitHub, and installed extensions (when online)

**Done when:** Logo displays correctly in marketplace and GitHub, graceful alt text fallback when offline

**Status:** Complete - Logo now uses GitHub raw content URL, displays everywhere with graceful offline fallback

---

#### 4G) Logo Strategy for Multi-Extension Monorepo — ✅ Complete

**Goal:** Define and implement centralized logo sourcing to avoid duplication across future extensions.

**Approach:**

- Store canonical icons at `/assets/` (root level)
- Create `scripts/sync-assets.sh` to copy to package directories during build
- Gitignore copied icons (build-time artifacts)
- Validate checksums to ensure consistency

**Tasks:**

- ✅ Create `/assets/` directory with icon files
- ✅ Write `scripts/sync-assets.sh` bash script with validation
- ✅ Add to vscode-extension pre-package workflow
- ✅ Gitignore copied icons in package directories
- ✅ Document strategy in `docs/ASSET-MANAGEMENT.md`
- ✅ Update root README to use `/assets/icon.png`

**Deliverables:**

- ✅ `/assets/icon.png` + `/assets/icon_large.png` (canonical sources)
- ✅ `scripts/sync-assets.sh` with checksum validation
- ✅ `docs/ASSET-MANAGEMENT.md` (concise documentation)
- ✅ Updated package.json pre-package hook
- ✅ `.gitignore` entries for build-time icons

**Done when:** Icons managed centrally, copied during build, validation ensures consistency

**Status:** Complete - Single source of truth for assets, no duplication in git, build validates consistency

---

#### 4H) Logo Origins - Nerdy Humor Section — 📋 Next Up

**Goal:** Add story about logo design with the Pi precision joke.

**Content Tone:** Light, fun, nerdy humor - celebrates the thought behind the design.

**Tasks:**
- Add "About the Logo" section to root README (near bottom, before license)
- Explain design elements:
  - Free range chicken (code roams free across editors)
  - Links (chains of collaboration)
  - Pi precision: 3.14 vs 3.1416 (because precision matters!)
- Add teaser to vscode-extension README linking back to root
- Credit designer: Yann Bohler (Instagram: @ybohler)

**Deliverables:**
- "About the Logo" section in root README
- Teaser link in extension README
- Designer credit with Instagram link

**Done when:** Logo story told, designer credited, links work

---

#### 4I) Contributors Section — 📋 Planned

**Tasks:**
- Add "Contributors" section to root README
- Credit Yann Bohler for logo design (Instagram: @ybohler)
- Add placeholder for future code contributors
- Link to `CONTRIBUTING.md`

**Deliverables:**
- Contributors section in root README

---

#### 4J) Content Drift Prevention Strategy — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Define strategy to prevent root and package READMEs from drifting apart.

**Approach:**
- **Root README:** Comprehensive, monorepo-focused, covers all packages/features
- **Package README:** Marketplace-optimized, user-focused, package-specific features only
- Document what content belongs where and when to update both

**Tasks:**
- Create `docs/README-CONTENT-STRATEGY.md`
- Define "shared content" sections (features, use cases)
- Define "package-specific" sections (installation, quickstart)
- Create checklist for README updates
- Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with README guidelines

**Deliverables:**
- `docs/README-CONTENT-STRATEGY.md`
- Updated CONTRIBUTING.md

**Done when:** Clear guidelines exist, easy to maintain consistency

---

### Priority 3: Build Tooling & Metadata

#### 4K) Enhanced Build Output with Metadata — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Display version, commit hash, date during package build for debugging.

**Tasks:**
- Enhance `scripts/generate-version.js` to output build metadata
- Modify `package` script to show metadata table after build:
  - Version
  - Commit hash
  - Commit date
  - Branch name
  - File count
- Test output formatting

**Deliverables:**
- Enhanced build script with metadata output
- Cleaner console output during packaging

**Done when:** Running `pnpm package` shows useful metadata, helps debug published versions

---

#### 4L) Embed Commit Hash in Extension Metadata — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Add build metadata to extension for runtime debugging.

**Tasks:**
- Extend `version.json` to include:
  - Commit hash (short and full)
  - Build date/time
  - Branch name
  - Dirty working tree flag
- Add "Show Version Info" command to display build metadata
- Update README with debugging section: "Finding version info"

**Note:** VS Code marketplace doesn't expose custom metadata in UI. This is for runtime debugging only.

**Deliverables:**
- Enhanced version.json with git metadata
- Command: "RangeLink: Show Version Info"
- Documentation on debugging published versions

**Done when:** Can identify exact commit used to build any installed extension

---

#### 4M) Separate Dev vs. Production Package Scripts — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Create distinct packaging workflows for development and marketplace publishing.

**Tasks:**
- Create `package:dev` script:
  - Allows dirty working tree
  - Adds `-dev` suffix to version
  - Faster iteration during development
- Keep `package` script strict:
  - Fails on uncommitted changes
  - Clean build only
  - For marketplace publishing
- Add `package:force` for emergency overrides
- Document when to use each in `PUBLISHING.md` and `DEVELOPMENT.md`

**Deliverables:**
- Three packaging scripts with clear semantics
- Updated documentation

**Done when:** Clear separation between dev and production builds, prevents accidental dirty publishes

---

### Known Limitations (Documented)

#### Repository Link in Marketplace

**Issue:** Marketplace "Repository" link points to monorepo root, not package directory.

**Status:** VS Code marketplace limitation - cannot override.

**Explanation:** The `repository.url` field in package.json determines the "Repository" link. The `homepage` field (correctly set) provides the package-specific "Homepage" link. This is expected behavior.

**Action:** Document in `PUBLISHING.md` as expected behavior.

---

#### Commit Hash Display on Marketplace Page

**Issue:** Cannot add commit hash or custom metadata to marketplace UI.

**Status:** Not supported by VS Code marketplace.

**Workaround:** Extension includes runtime command to show build metadata (see iteration 4L).

**Action:** Already addressed via "Show Version Info" command.

---
