# RangeLink Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for RangeLink across all packages (core library, VSCode extension, and future plugins).

> **Development Approach:** We use **micro-iterations** (1-2 hours each) to prevent feature creep and maintain momentum. Each iteration has clear scope, time estimates, and "done when" criteria. This allows for frequent commits, easy progress tracking, and natural stopping points.

## Development Principles

Our roadmap follows these core principles to ensure sustainable, high-quality development:

1. **Micro-Iterations (1-2 hours max)**
   - Each iteration is small enough to complete in one focused session
   - Clear "done when" criteria prevent scope creep
   - Time estimates help with planning and prioritization

2. **One Focus Per Iteration**
   - Feature work and refactoring are separate iterations
   - Never mix unrelated changes in a single iteration
   - Keeps commits clean and reviewable

3. **Commit Early, Commit Often**
   - Commit after each micro-iteration, even if incomplete
   - Use `[WIP]` or `[PARTIAL]` tags when appropriate
   - Git history reflects incremental progress

4. **Explicit Scope Definition**
   - Document what IS and IS NOT in scope upfront
   - Prevents "just one more thing" syndrome
   - Makes it easy to defer work to next iteration

5. **Test-Driven Quality**
   - Aim for 100% branch coverage
   - Write tests during iteration, not after
   - Skipped tests are documented with tracking issues

## Phase 1: Core Enhancements â€” âœ… Mostly Complete

Phase 1 is split into three iterative sub-phases focusing on rectangular mode support, robust delimiter validation, and portable link generation. Each sub-phase uses micro-iterations for focused, incremental progress.

**Overall Status:**

- âœ… 1A: Rectangular Mode format (double hash) - Complete
- âœ… 1B: Reserved character validation and delimiter constraints - Complete
- ðŸ”¨ 1C: Portable link (BYOD) generation - Complete; parsing in progress
- ðŸ“¦ Major refactoring: Test modernization with ES6 imports and TypeScript types - Complete

### 1A) Rectangular Mode Format (Double Hash) â€” âœ… Completed

**Objective:** Use double `delimHash` to indicate rectangular mode selections in a delimiter-agnostic way.

**Implementation:**

- Detects rectangular mode: multiple selections with identical character ranges across consecutive lines
- Format: `path##L10C5-L20C10` (double hash indicates rectangular mode)
- Works with any `delimHash` value (single or multi-character)
- Example: if `delimHash="##"`, rectangular mode uses `####` (4 hash characters)

**Test Coverage Achieved:**

- âœ… Default delimiters, custom single-character, and multi-character delimiters
- âœ… Edge cases: line 0, column 0, large numbers, min/max selections
- âœ… Negative cases: non-consecutive lines, different ranges, single selection
- âœ… Path handling: relative and absolute paths

**Future Compatibility:**

- Scales to multi-range rectangular mode: `path##L10C5-L20C10,L30C5-L40C10`
- Circular ranges are mutually exclusive with rectangular mode (circular takes precedence)

---

### 1B) Reserved Character Validation and Delimiter Constraints â€” âœ… Completed

**Objective:** Enforce strict validation rules to prevent parsing ambiguities and ensure forward compatibility.

**Reserved Characters** (cannot be used in delimiter configurations):

- `~` - Portable link metadata separator (BYOD format)
- `|` - Reserved for future expansion
- `/`, `\` - File path separators
- `:` - Single-line reference format (`path:42`)
- Whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) - Would break parsing
- `,` - Reserved for multi-range separator: `path#L10-L20,L30-L40`
- `@` - Reserved for circular/radius selection: `path#L10C5@15`

**Core Validation Rules:**

1. **Delimiters cannot be empty**
2. **Delimiters cannot contain digits** - Critical: ensures numeric tokens (line numbers, column positions, radius values) always parse with priority over delimiter matching
3. **All delimiters must be unique** - No two delimiters can be identical
4. **No subset/superset relationships** - A delimiter cannot be a substring of another delimiter

For detailed validation rules and implementation details, see [ERROR-HANDLING.md](./ERROR-HANDLING.md).

**Implementation:**

- Structured logging with stable error codes for each validation failure
- Aggregated error reporting: all issues shown at once, then defaults applied
- INFO log when defaults are used (`MSG_1002`)
- Defensive guard for unexpected validation states

For logging details, see [LOGGING.md](./LOGGING.md).

**Test Coverage Achieved:**

- Each reserved character across all four delimiters
- Digits, empty values, and whitespace detection
- Uniqueness and substring conflicts (start, end, middle)
- Aggregated errors when multiple problems occur simultaneously
- Confirmation that defaults are used and logged via INFO when config is invalid

---

### 1C) Portable Link (BYOD/BYODELI ðŸ¥ª) Generation and Parsing â€” ðŸ”¨ Generation Complete, Parsing in Progress

**Objective:** Generate and parse links with embedded delimiter metadata so teams can share code references seamlessly regardless of delimiter configurations.

For comprehensive BYOD documentation, see [BYOD.md](./BYOD.md).

**Status (Micro-Iteration Approach):**

- âœ… **Generation: Complete** (commands, keybindings, context menu, metadata composition)
- âœ… **Single-character hash validation**: Enforced for user configuration
- âœ… **Test suite modernization**: ES6 imports, proper TypeScript types, 114 passing tests
- ðŸ“‹ **Parsing** (broken into focused micro-iterations):
  - ðŸ“‹ **1C.1** (1.5h): Parse metadata structure, extract delimiters, format validation
  - ðŸ“‹ **1C.2** (1.5h): Validate extracted delimiters (reserved chars, digits, conflicts)
  - ðŸ“‹ **1C.3** (2h): Recovery logic (missing delimiters, fallbacks, error UI)
  - ðŸ“‹ **1C.4** (1h): Rectangular mode detection with custom BYOD hash
  - ðŸ“‹ **1C.5** (30m): Documentation and cleanup
- ðŸ“‹ **Navigation: Planned** (Phase 3)

**Micro-Iteration Benefits:**

- Each iteration is 1-2 hours (completable in one session)
- Clear scope and stopping points prevent feature creep
- Can commit after each micro-iteration
- Easy to track progress and estimate remaining work

**Format:**

- Line-only: `path#L10-L20~#~L~-~`
- With columns: `path#L10C5-L20C10~#~L~-~C~`
- Rectangular Mode: `path##L10C5-L20C10~#~L~-~C~` (note double hash in range part)

For detailed format specifications, see [LINK-FORMATS.md](./LINK-FORMATS.md) and [BYOD.md](./BYOD.md).

**Exposure:**

- Command: "RangeLink: Create Portable Link"
- Context menu: "Copy Portable RangeLink"
- Keybinding: `Cmd+R Cmd+P` / `Ctrl+R Ctrl+P` (two-key chord)

## Phase 2: Core Architecture and Monorepo â€” âœ… Complete

We modularized the project and adopted a monorepo to enable fast, iterative development with world-class code quality.

**High-Level Objectives:**

- âœ… Extract core logic into `rangelink-core-ts` (pure TypeScript, npm package)
- âœ… Keep IDE extensions as thin wrappers (VSCode, Neovim)
- âœ… Enable rapid iteration with 100% branch coverage

For architectural details, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

### 2A) Monorepo Setup â€” âœ… Complete (15 minutes)

- âœ… Created `pnpm-workspace.yaml` at root
- âœ… Moved `src/` to `packages/rangelink-vscode-extension/src/`
- âœ… Updated `package.json` (root workspace + extension package)
- âœ… Created `tsconfig.base.json` for shared configuration
- âœ… Verified compilation and all tests pass in new structure
- **Result:** Clean monorepo structure, no code changes, all tests green

### 2B) Extract Core Library Foundation â€” âœ… Complete (~45 minutes)

**Status:** âœ… Completed ahead of schedule (2h estimate â†’ 45min actual)

**Achievements:**

- âœ… Created `packages/rangelink-core-ts/` with modular structure
- âœ… Implemented pure TypeScript core with **zero runtime dependencies**
- âœ… Anti-corruption layer: Core defines its own `Selection` interface (no VSCode coupling)
- âœ… Functional error handling with `Result<T, E>` type
- âœ… Portable logging infrastructure (`Logger`, `LogManager`, `NoOpLogger`)
- âœ… **100% branch coverage** (15 test suites, 95 passing tests)
- âœ… All validation, selection, and formatting logic extracted and tested

**Structure:**

```
packages/rangelink-core-ts/
  src/
    types/         # Domain types, enums (PathFormat, RangeFormat, etc.)
    constants/     # RESERVED_CHARS, DEFAULT_DELIMITERS, etc.
    validation/    # validateDelimiter, areDelimitersUnique, haveSubstringConflicts
    selection/     # isRectangularSelection, computeRangeSpec
    formatting/    # buildAnchor, formatLink, formatPortableLink
