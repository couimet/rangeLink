# RangeLink Roadmap

_Future development plans and in-progress work._

> **Looking for completed work?** See [JOURNEY.md](./JOURNEY.md)
>
> **Looking for rejected features?** See [CEMETERY.md](./CEMETERY.md)

---

> **Development Approach:** We use **micro-iterations** (1-2 hours each) to prevent feature creep and maintain momentum. Each iteration has clear scope, time estimates, and "done when" criteria. This allows for frequent commits, easy progress tracking, and natural stopping points.

## Development Principles

Our roadmap follows these core principles to ensure sustainable, high-quality development:

1. **Micro-Iterations (1-2 hours max)**
   - Each iteration is small enough to complete in one focused session
   - Clear "done when" criteria prevent scope creep
   - Time estimates help with planning and prioritization

2. **One Focus Per Iteration**
   - Feature work and refactoring are separate iterations
   - Never mix unrelated changes in a single iteration
   - Keeps commits clean and reviewable

3. **Commit Early, Commit Often**
   - Commit after each micro-iteration, even if incomplete
   - Use `[WIP]` or `[PARTIAL]` tags when appropriate
   - Git history reflects incremental progress

4. **Explicit Scope Definition**
   - Document what IS and IS NOT in scope upfront
   - Prevents "just one more thing" syndrome
   - Makes it easy to defer work to next iteration

5. **Test-Driven Quality**
   - Aim for 100% branch coverage
   - Write tests during iteration, not after
   - Skipped tests are documented with tracking issues

## Phase 1C: BYOD Parsing — 📋 Planned

**Objective:** Parse links with embedded delimiter metadata so teams can consume code references seamlessly regardless of delimiter configurations.

For comprehensive BYOD documentation, see [BYOD.md](./BYOD.md).

**Status:** Generation complete, parsing split into focused micro-iterations:

- 📋 **1C.1** (1.5h): Parse metadata structure, extract delimiters, format validation
- 📋 **1C.2** (1.5h): Validate extracted delimiters (reserved chars, digits, conflicts)
- 📋 **1C.3** (2h): Recovery logic (missing delimiters, fallbacks, error UI)
- 📋 **1C.4** (1h): Rectangular mode detection with custom BYOD hash
- 📋 **1C.5** (30m): Documentation and cleanup

**Format Examples:**

- Line-only: `path#L10-L20~#~L~-~`
- With columns: `path#L10C5-L20C10~#~L~-~C~`
- Rectangular Mode: `path##L10C5-L20C10~#~L~-~C~` (note double hash in range part)

For detailed format specifications, see [LINK-FORMATS.md](./LINK-FORMATS.md) and [BYOD.md](./BYOD.md).

---

## Phase 2D: Neovim Plugin Shell — 📋 Planned (1 hour)

- Create `packages/rangelink-neovim-plugin/` with basic Lua structure
- Implement one command: `:RangeLinkCopy` (calls core via Node CLI)
- Basic README and installation instructions
- **Done when:** Can install plugin and copy a basic link in Neovim

For Neovim integration details, see [neovim-integration.md](./neovim-integration.md).

---

## Phase 2E: CI/CD Pipeline — 📋 Planned (1 hour)

- Add GitHub Actions workflow
- Run tests on PR (per-package)
- Automated npm publish on tag (core package only)
- **Done when:** CI passes on PR, publishes on tag

---

## Phase 3: VSCode Marketplace Launch — 📋 Remaining Items

**Goal:** Complete remaining publishing tasks for VSCode Marketplace.

**Completed:** Developer tooling, extension icon/logo (see [JOURNEY.md](./JOURNEY.md) for details)

### 3I) GitHub Social Preview Banner (45 minutes) — 📋 Optional Polish

**Goal:** Create custom social preview image for better link sharing on social media, messaging apps, and GitHub.

**Background:**
When someone shares your GitHub repo link on SMS, WhatsApp, Slack, Twitter, etc., GitHub generates a preview card. By default, it uses a generic layout. A custom banner makes your project stand out and drives more clicks/installs.

**Tasks:**

- Design 1280×640px banner image featuring:
  - RangeLink logo (your chicken + BYODELI badge)
  - Project tagline: "Share Code Across Editors & Tools"
  - Example code reference: `#L3C14-L314C16` (Pi reference)
  - Visual elements: Code snippet background, subtle tech aesthetic
  - Color palette: Orange (#FF6B35), cream/beige, with dark/light versions for contrast
- Upload to GitHub: Repo Settings → General → Social preview
- Test the preview by sharing repo link in messaging apps

**Banner Description/Content Suggestions:**

Option A - Clean & Professional:

```
Top: RangeLink logo (centered or left-aligned)
Middle: Large tagline "Share Precise Code References"
Bottom: Example link "src/auth.ts#L3C14-L314C16" in monospace font
Background: Subtle gradient (cream to orange) or code snippet texture
```

Option B - Developer-Focused:

```
Left 40%: Large RangeLink logo + BYODELI badge
Right 60%:
  - "RangeLink" title
  - "Cross-editor code references"
  - Example: path#L3C14-L314C16
  - Small icons: VSCode + Cursor + GitHub logos
Background: Dark theme with syntax-highlighted code snippet
```

Option C - Minimal Hero:

```
Centered composition:
  - RangeLink logo (large, 200px)
  - "Share Code References That Just Work"
  - "#L3C14-L314C16" in highlighted badge
Background: Two-tone split (orange left, cream right) or solid with overlay
```

**Design Tools:**

- Figma (recommended for precise control)
- Canva (templates available, easier)
- Shopp-E + Photoshop (AI-generated base + manual composition)
- GitHub's own social preview generator (basic)

**Testing:**
After uploading, test by:

1. Sharing repo link in Slack/Discord (preview should show your banner)
2. Using Twitter Card Validator: https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator
3. Using Facebook Debugger: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
4. Checking on mobile (SMS preview)

**Resources & References:**

- GitHub guide: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/customizing-your-repositorys-social-media-preview
- Recommended size: 1280×640px (2:1 ratio)
- File size: Under 1MB (PNG or JPG)
- Repository topics to highlight: vscode-extension, developer-tools, productivity, code-navigation, ai-tools

**Banner Copy/Text Elements:**

**Primary headline options:**

- "Share Code Across Editors & Tools"
- "Precise Code References for Developers"
- "Cross-Editor Code Sharing Made Easy"
- "From VSCode to claude-code - Links That Just Work"

**Supporting text:**

- "GitHub-style notation • Portable links • AI-ready"
- "Works with VSCode, Cursor, claude-code & more"
- "Perfect for documentation, code reviews, and AI prompts"

**Call to action (optional):**

- "Available on VSCode Marketplace"
- "Install Extension →"

**Done when:** Banner uploaded to GitHub, preview tested and looks professional across platforms

### 3J) Fix README Logo Display in Installed Extension — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Make the RangeLink logo display in the installed extension's README view for fully offline functionality.

**Problem:** VS Code's extension view doesn't render markdown images with relative paths (`./icon.png`) when displaying the README in the installed extension details panel. The image works on GitHub but not in the local extension view.

**Current Status:**

- ✅ `icon.png` (35KB) exists in package root
- ✅ `package.json` correctly specifies `"icon": "icon.png"` (this shows in marketplace listing)
- ✅ `.vscodeignore` explicitly includes `icon.png` in packaged extension
- ⚠️ README line 4 uses relative path: `<img src="./icon.png" alt="RangeLink Logo" width="128" />`

**Solution: Base64 Data URI Embedding**

Convert the icon to base64 and embed directly in the README markdown. This makes the README fully self-contained and works offline without any network requests.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Generate base64 encoding of `icon.png`:

   ```bash
   base64 -i icon.png | tr -d '\n' > /tmp/icon_base64.txt
   ```

2. Create data URI format:

   ```bash
   echo -n "data:image/png;base64," > /tmp/data_uri.txt
   cat /tmp/icon_base64.txt >> /tmp/data_uri.txt
   ```

3. Update README.md line 4:
   ```markdown
   <img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS..." alt="RangeLink Logo" width="128" />
   ```

**Testing:**

- [ ] Logo displays in installed extension view (Extensions → RangeLink → Details)
- [ ] Logo still displays on GitHub repository
- [ ] Logo displays in VS Code marketplace listing
- [ ] Logo displays in Cursor marketplace listing

**Tradeoffs:**

- **Pros:** Works completely offline, no external dependencies, single source of truth
- **Cons:** Adds ~48KB to README file size (base64 encoding inflates by ~33%)

**Alternative Considered (Rejected):**

- Using absolute GitHub URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couimet/rangelink/main/packages/rangelink-vscode-extension/icon.png`
- **Rejected because:** Requires internet connection, fails for users without network access

**Done when:** Logo displays correctly in all contexts (installed extension, GitHub, marketplace), README is fully self-contained

### Time Summary

| Task                                | Estimate | Cumulative |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | ---------- |

| Post-launch                         | 30m      | 3h 50m     |
| **GitHub social banner (optional)** | **45m**  | **4h 35m** |

**Total:** ~4 hours for launch (up to 4.5 hours with optional banner)

---

## Phase 4: Post-Publishing Enhancements — 📋 Remaining Items

**Completed:** Git tagging, CHANGELOG, release strategy, README enhancements, logo work, contributors section (see [JOURNEY.md](./JOURNEY.md) for details)

### Priority 1: Release Management & Tracking

#### 4D) GitHub Actions Release Workflow — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Automate release tagging and GitHub release creation.

**Deferred from:** Iteration 4C (Monorepo Release Strategy Design)

**Tasks:**

- Create `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Trigger on version tag push
- Automate GitHub release creation
- Extract changelog for release notes

**Done when:** Pushing a tag automatically creates GitHub release

---

### Priority 1.5: Test Coverage Improvements

#### 4A.5) Error Logging Verification in Tests — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Add test coverage to verify that all catch blocks properly log errors via getLogger().

**Background:** Phase 7 refactoring added comprehensive error logging to all catch blocks in the extension, but tests only verify that error messages are shown to users - they don't verify that errors are logged for debugging.

**Current Gap:**

- ✅ Tests verify `showErrorMessage()` is called with correct messages
- ✅ Tests verify clipboard not written on errors
- ❌ Tests DO NOT verify `getLogger().error()` or `getLogger().warn()` is called
- ❌ No verification of logged context (fn, error object, metadata)

**Tasks:**

- Mock `getLogger()` in test setup
- Add assertions for `mockLogger.error()` calls in error handling tests
- Verify proper context is logged (function name, error object, additional metadata)
- Add tests for all 4 catch blocks in extension.ts:
  1. `toInputSelection()` error (document modified) - should call `getLogger().error()`
  2. `generateLinkFromSelection()` catch - should call `getLogger().error()`
  3. `showVersion` command failure - should call `getLogger().error()`
  4. `activate()` version load failure - should call `getLogger().warn()`

**Deliverables:**

- Mock logger in test harness
- Test assertions for error logging in all error paths
- Documentation of logging test patterns in CONTRIBUTING.md

**Done when:** Tests fail if error logging is removed from catch blocks, all 4 catch blocks covered

**Estimated Time:** 1.5 hours

---

### Priority 2: Documentation Content Strategy

#### 4J) Content Drift Prevention Strategy — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Define strategy to prevent root and package READMEs from drifting apart.

**Approach:**

- **Root README:** Comprehensive, monorepo-focused, covers all packages/features
- **Package README:** Marketplace-optimized, user-focused, package-specific features only
- Document what content belongs where and when to update both

**Tasks:**

- Create `docs/README-CONTENT-STRATEGY.md`
- Define "shared content" sections (features, use cases)
- Define "package-specific" sections (installation, quickstart)
- Create checklist for README updates
- Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with README guidelines

**Deliverables:**

- `docs/README-CONTENT-STRATEGY.md`
- Updated CONTRIBUTING.md

**Done when:** Clear guidelines exist, easy to maintain consistency

---

### Priority 3: Build Tooling & Metadata

#### 4K) Enhanced Build Output with Metadata — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Display version, commit hash, date during package build for debugging.

**Tasks:**

- Enhance `scripts/generate-version.js` to output build metadata
- Modify `package` script to show metadata table after build:
  - Version
  - Commit hash
  - Commit date
  - Branch name
  - File count
- Test output formatting

**Deliverables:**

- Enhanced build script with metadata output
- Cleaner console output during packaging

**Done when:** Running `pnpm package` shows useful metadata, helps debug published versions

---

#### 4L) Embed Commit Hash in Extension Metadata — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Add build metadata to extension for runtime debugging.

**Tasks:**

- Extend `version.json` to include:
  - Commit hash (short and full)
  - Build date/time
  - Branch name
  - Dirty working tree flag
- Add "Show Version Info" command to display build metadata
- Update README with debugging section: "Finding version info"

**Note:** VS Code marketplace doesn't expose custom metadata in UI. This is for runtime debugging only.

**Deliverables:**

- Enhanced version.json with git metadata
- Command: "RangeLink: Show Version Info"
- Documentation on debugging published versions

**Done when:** Can identify exact commit used to build any installed extension

---

#### 4M) Separate Dev vs. Production Package Scripts — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Create distinct packaging workflows for development and marketplace publishing.

**Tasks:**

- Create `package:dev` script:
  - Allows dirty working tree
  - Adds `-dev` suffix to version
  - Faster iteration during development
- Keep `package` script strict:
  - Fails on uncommitted changes
  - Clean build only
  - For marketplace publishing
- Add `package:force` for emergency overrides
- Document when to use each in `PUBLISHING.md` and `DEVELOPMENT.md`

**Deliverables:**

- Three packaging scripts with clear semantics
- Updated documentation

**Done when:** Clear separation between dev and production builds, prevents accidental dirty publishes

---

### Known Limitations (Documented)

#### Repository Link in Marketplace

**Issue:** Marketplace "Repository" link points to monorepo root, not package directory.

**Status:** VS Code marketplace limitation - cannot override.

**Explanation:** The `repository.url` field in package.json determines the "Repository" link. The `homepage` field (correctly set) provides the package-specific "Homepage" link. This is expected behavior.

**Action:** Document in `PUBLISHING.md` as expected behavior.

---

#### Commit Hash Display on Marketplace Page

**Issue:** Cannot add commit hash or custom metadata to marketplace UI.

**Status:** Not supported by VS Code marketplace.

**Workaround:** Extension includes runtime command to show build metadata (see iteration 4L).

**Action:** Already addressed via "Show Version Info" command.

---

## Phase 4.5: Technical Debt & Refactoring — 📋 Planned

### 4.5A) Remove Test Re-exports from extension.ts — ✅ Complete

**Completed:** 2025-11-05

**Summary:** Updated test and public API imports to use direct source file paths instead of re-exporting through extension.ts. Tests now import from actual source files for clearer dependencies.

**See [JOURNEY.md](./JOURNEY.md#phase-45a-remove-test-re-exports-from-extensionts--complete) for full details.**

---

### 4.5B) Separate Extension Config Loading from Core Validation (3-4 hours)

**ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEM:** Extension and core responsibilities are badly intertwined. Extension tests are testing core validation logic instead of extension concerns. This created technical debt including `getErrorCodeForTesting()` mapping function.

**Current Problems:**

1. **Improperly scoped tests** (`extension.test.ts` lines 1347-2635, now skipped):
   - Tests check core validation logic (digits, whitespace, reserved chars)
   - Tests check core error codes (`ERR_1002`, `ERR_1003`)
   - Should test extension behavior (config source, delimiter usage)

2. **`getErrorCodeForTesting()` is a symptom**:
   - Maps `DelimiterValidationError` → `RangeLinkMessageCode`
   - Exists because extension does validation instead of delegating to core
   - Brittle: breaks when enum values change (Phase 4.5J)

3. **`loadDelimiterConfig()` does too much** (`extension.ts` lines 67-162):
   - Calls core validation directly (`validateDelimiter()`)
   - Maps validation errors to message codes
   - Logs errors using extension's `outputChannel`
   - Should just: load config, call core, log result

**Extension Responsibilities (What SHOULD Be Tested):**

- ✅ **Config source priority**: Workspace folder > Workspace > User > Default
- ✅ **Source logging**: "Loaded from workspace folder", "Using defaults"
- ✅ **Resulting delimiters**: "Using: line='L', position='C', hash='#', range='-'"
- ❌ **NOT validation logic**: That's core's job

**Refactoring Plan:**

**Step 1: Core provides validation result with message code (1h)**
- Core's `validateDelimiter()` returns: `Result<string, RangeLinkMessageCode>`
- Eliminates `DelimiterValidationError` enum
- Core includes message code directly in error result

**Step 2: Extension delegates validation to core (1h)**
- `loadDelimiterConfig()` becomes thin wrapper:
  ```typescript
  function loadDelimiterConfig(): DelimiterConfig {
    const config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('rangelink');
    const userDelimiters = { /* ... load from config ... */ };

    // Delegate to core for validation
    const validationResult = core.validateDelimiterConfig(userDelimiters);

    if (!validationResult.success) {
      logValidationErrors(validationResult.errors); // Just log, don't validate
      return DEFAULT_DELIMITERS;
    }

    logConfigSource(config); // Extension-specific logging
    return validationResult.value;
  }
  ```

**Step 3: Delete `getErrorCodeForTesting()` (15min)**
- No longer needed - core provides message codes directly
- Remove function and all references

**Step 4: Rewrite extension tests (1-2h)**
- Un-skip the 73 tests
- Focus on extension concerns:
  - Mock core validation (success/failure)
  - Test config source detection
  - Test logging of results
  - NOT validation logic itself

**Files Modified:**

- `packages/rangelink-core-ts/src/validation/validateDelimiter.ts` - Return message codes
- `packages/rangelink-vscode-extension/src/extension.ts` - Thin config loading
- `packages/rangelink-vscode-extension/src/__tests__/extension.test.ts` - Proper scope

**Benefits:**

- Clear separation of concerns (extension vs core)
- Tests test the right layer
- No more brittle mapping function
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Eliminates technical debt

**Done when:**

- `getErrorCodeForTesting()` deleted
- Core returns `Result<T, RangeLinkMessageCode>` for validation
- Extension delegates validation to core
- All tests pass (including un-skipped ones)
- Tests properly scoped to extension concerns

---

### 4.5C) Remove or Refactor Link Interface (15 minutes)

**Problem:** `extension.ts` contains a `Link` interface marked as "kept for extension API" but it's unclear if it's actually used:

```typescript
/**
 * VSCode-specific link interface (kept for extension API)
 */
export interface Link {
  path: string;
  startLine: number;
  endLine: number;
  startPosition?: number;
  endPosition?: number;
  isAbsolute: boolean;
}
```

**Goal:** Determine if this interface is necessary and either remove it or document its purpose

**Changes:**

- Search codebase for all usages of `Link` interface
- If unused: delete it
- If used: move to appropriate file with clear documentation
- Update tests if needed

**Done when:** `Link` interface is either removed or properly documented with clear ownership

---

### 4.5D) Refactor Module-Level outputChannel Dependency (30 minutes)

**Problem:** `getErrorCodeForTesting` function depends on module-level `outputChannel` variable:

```typescript
default: {
  outputChannel.appendLine(
    `[CRITICAL] Unhandled DelimiterValidationError in getErrorCodeForTesting: ${error}`,
  );
  return RangeLinkMessageCode.CONFIG_ERR_UNKNOWN;
}
```

**Goal:** Eliminate implicit dependency on module-level global state

**Note:** This will likely be resolved by 4.5B (eliminating the function entirely), but if the function remains, it should receive logger as parameter instead of accessing global.

**Done when:** No functions in `extension.ts` directly access module-level variables (prefer dependency injection)

---

### 4.5E) Replace outputChannel.appendLine with getLogger() (30 minutes)

**Problem:** `extension.ts` has inconsistent logging - some code uses `getLogger()` (proper abstraction) while other code uses raw `outputChannel.appendLine()` directly

**Examples of raw outputChannel usage:**

- `loadDelimiterConfig()` function (lines 151-160 and throughout)
- Other config loading/validation code

**Why it's wrong:**

- Logger is initialized BEFORE these functions run (no lifecycle issue)
- Bypasses the structured logging abstraction (`getLogger()` from core)
- Inconsistent with rest of codebase
- Makes code harder to test (implicit dependency on module-level variable)

**Goal:** All logging should go through `getLogger()` for consistency

**Changes:**

- Replace all `outputChannel.appendLine()` calls with `getLogger().info()` / `.warn()` / `.error()`
- Ensure structured logging format is maintained
- Update any tests that mock `outputChannel` directly

**Done when:**

- No direct `outputChannel.appendLine()` calls remain in `extension.ts`
- All logging goes through `getLogger()` abstraction
- All tests pass

---

### 4.5F) Extract Command Registration from activate() Function (30 minutes)

**Problem:** The `activate()` function is 90 lines long with 60+ lines of inline command registration. This creates:

- Poor testability (can't test command registration separately)
- High coupling (activate does setup + registration + logging)
- Poor scoping (7 commands registered inline with duplicated patterns)

**Current structure:**

```typescript
export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext): void {
  // Setup (lines 174-182)
  outputChannel = ...
  setLogger(...)
  const service = ...
  const terminalBindingManager = ...

  // Command registration (lines 184-244) - 60 lines inline!
  context.subscriptions.push(vscode.commands.registerCommand(...))
  context.subscriptions.push(vscode.commands.registerCommand(...))
  context.subscriptions.push(vscode.commands.registerCommand(...))
  // ... 7 total commands

  // Activation logging (lines 246-261)
  getLogger().info(...)
}
```

**Target structure:**

```typescript
export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext): void {
  outputChannel = vscode.window.createOutputChannel('RangeLink');
  setLogger(new VSCodeLogger(outputChannel));

  const delimiters = loadDelimiterConfig();
  const terminalBindingManager = new TerminalBindingManager(context);
  const service = new RangeLinkService(delimiters, terminalBindingManager);

  registerCommands(context, service, terminalBindingManager);

  logActivation();
}

function registerCommands(
  context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
  service: RangeLinkService,
  terminalBindingManager: TerminalBindingManager,
): void {
  // All command registration logic here
  // Can be tested separately
  // Clear function boundary
}

function logActivation(): void {
  // Activation logging logic
}
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Activate function becomes ~15 lines (setup → register → log)
- ✅ Command registration testable in isolation
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Easier to add new commands
- ✅ Reduced coupling

**Changes:**

- Create `registerCommands()` helper function
- Create `logActivation()` helper function
- Update `activate()` to call helpers
- Consider: Move helpers to separate file (`src/commands.ts`) if they grow

**Done when:**

- `activate()` function is ~15 lines
- Command registration extracted to `registerCommands()`
- All tests pass

---

### 4.5G) Fix TerminalBindingManager Resource Leak — ✅ Complete

**Completed:** 2025-11-05

**Summary:** Fixed resource leak by adding `context.subscriptions.push(terminalBindingManager)` to ensure VSCode automatically calls `dispose()` on deactivation. Terminal close event listeners are now properly cleaned up.

**See [JOURNEY.md](./JOURNEY.md#phase-45g-fix-terminalbindingmanager-resource-leak--complete) for full details.**

---

### 4.5H) Extract RangeLinkService Tests to Separate File (45 minutes)

**Problem:** `RangeLinkService` class was extracted to `RangeLinkService.ts` but its 1116 lines of tests remain in `extension.test.ts` (lines 129-1244)

**Goal:** Test file structure should mirror source file structure

**Current structure:**

```
src/
  extension.ts
  RangeLinkService.ts              ← Extracted
  __tests__/
    extension.test.ts               ← Contains RangeLinkService tests (1116 lines)
```

**Target structure:**

```
src/
  extension.ts
  RangeLinkService.ts
  __tests__/
    extension.test.ts               ← Config, lifecycle tests only
    RangeLinkService.test.ts        ← Dedicated test file for service
```

**Changes:**

- Create `__tests__/RangeLinkService.test.ts`
- Move `describe('RangeLinkService', ...)` block and related helpers from `extension.test.ts`
- Move `createMockTerminalBindingManager` helper if only used by RangeLinkService tests
- Update imports in extracted test file
- Ensure all 130 tests still pass

**Done when:**

- `RangeLinkService.test.ts` exists with ~1116 lines of tests
- `extension.test.ts` reduced to ~2070 lines (config, lifecycle, portable link tests)
- All tests pass with same coverage

---

### 4.5I) Eliminate CONFIG_UNKNOWN Catch-All Error Code (1 hour)

**Problem:** `CONFIG_UNKNOWN = 'CONFIG_UNKNOWN'` is a catch-all error code that defeats the purpose of descriptive error handling.

**Why this is tech debt:**

- Catch-all codes make debugging difficult - you can't tell what actually went wrong
- When someone sees `CONFIG_UNKNOWN` in logs, they have no context
- Goes against our architectural principle: "descriptive values provide immediate context"
- Forces developers to read full error messages instead of recognizing the error by code

**Root cause:** Defensive programming without identifying all specific error cases upfront.

**Goal:** Replace `CONFIG_UNKNOWN` with specific error codes for each actual failure scenario.

**Investigation needed:**

- Audit all code paths that could throw `CONFIG_UNKNOWN`
- Identify distinct error scenarios (e.g., `CONFIG_VALIDATION_FAILED`, `CONFIG_PARSE_ERROR`, `CONFIG_UNSUPPORTED_VALUE`)
- Create specific error codes with clear names
- Update error handling to use specific codes

**Changes:**

- Analyze usage of `CONFIG_UNKNOWN` in codebase
- Define specific error codes for each scenario
- Update `RangeLinkErrorCodes` enum with new codes
- Replace all `CONFIG_UNKNOWN` throws with specific codes
- Remove `CONFIG_UNKNOWN` from enum
- Update tests to expect specific error codes
- Update documentation

**Done when:**

- `CONFIG_UNKNOWN` deleted from `RangeLinkErrorCodes`
- All error scenarios have descriptive, specific error codes
- Tests verify specific error codes (not catch-all)
- Error logs provide immediate clarity about what went wrong

**Reference:** See `SharedErrorCodes` pattern - even generic codes like `VALIDATION` are more specific than "UNKNOWN".

### 4.5J) Convert RangeLinkMessageCode to Descriptive Values — ✅ Complete

**Completed:** 2025-11-05

**Summary:** Converted `RangeLinkMessageCode` from numeric values (MSG_1001) to descriptive values matching keys exactly (CONFIG_LOADED). Removed 11 obsolete SELECTION_* codes, organized by human-readable categories (CONFIG, BYOD), and updated VSCode extension references. Coverage insight: enum will achieve natural test coverage when i18n is implemented via `Record<RangeLinkMessageCode, string>` translation maps.

**See [JOURNEY.md](./JOURNEY.md#phase-45j-convert-rangelinkmessagecode-to-descriptive-values--complete) for full details.**

---

### 4.5K) Logger Verification Feature (debug + pingLog) (1 hour) — 📋 Planned

**Problem:** The extension calls `setLogger(new VSCodeLogger(outputChannel))` during activation but has no way to verify the logger was initialized correctly. If logger setup fails silently, all subsequent logging will fail without clear indication.

**Goal:** Add `debug()` log level and `pingLog()` standalone function to verify logging communication channel works at all levels.

**Design Principle:** Keep Logger interface clean. `pingLog()` is a standalone function (not a method) that exercises the Logger interface without coupling.

**Implementation:**

**Step 1: Add debug() method to Logger interface (15min)**

```typescript
// packages/rangelink-core-ts/src/logging/Logger.ts
export interface Logger {
  debug(context: object, message: string): void;  // ← New: diagnostic level
  info(context: object, message: string): void;
  warn(context: object, message: string): void;
  error(context: object, message: string): void;
}
```

**Step 2: setLogger() confirms initialization immediately (15min)**

```typescript
// packages/rangelink-core-ts/src/logging/LogManager.ts
export const setLogger = (newLogger: Logger): void => {
  logger = newLogger;
  // Confirm communication channel works immediately
  logger.debug({ fn: 'setLogger' }, 'Logger initialized');
};
```

**Step 3: Create standalone pingLog() function (20min)**

```typescript
// packages/rangelink-core-ts/src/logging/pingLog.ts
import { getLogger } from './LogManager';

/**
 * Exercise all logger levels to verify communication channel.
 * Extension tests use this to confirm core → outputChannel binding works.
 *
 * No return value - extension observes outputChannel for messages.
 */
export const pingLog = (): void => {
  const logger = getLogger();
  const context = { fn: 'pingLog' };

  logger.debug(context, 'Ping for DEBUG');
  logger.info(context, 'Ping for INFO');
  logger.warn(context, 'Ping for WARN');
  logger.error(context, 'Ping for ERROR');
};
```

**Step 4: Implement debug() in VSCodeLogger (10min)**

```typescript
// packages/rangelink-vscode-extension/src/VSCodeLogger.ts
export class VSCodeLogger implements Logger {
  constructor(private outputChannel: vscode.OutputChannel) {}

  debug(context: object, message: string): void {
    this.log('[DEBUG]', context, message);
  }

  info(context: object, message: string): void {
    this.log('[INFO]', context, message);
  }

  // ... other methods
}
```

**Step 5: Tests verify communication channel (remainder)**

```typescript
// Extension tests use pingLog() to verify binding
import { pingLog } from 'rangelink-core-ts';

it('should verify logger communication channel', () => {
  const mockOutputChannel = { appendLine: jest.fn() };
  const logger = new VSCodeLogger(mockOutputChannel);
  setLogger(logger);

  // Exercise all log levels
  pingLog();

  // Verify outputChannel received all 4 messages
  expect(mockOutputChannel.appendLine).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    expect.stringContaining('[DEBUG]')
  );
  expect(mockOutputChannel.appendLine).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    expect.stringContaining('Ping for DEBUG')
  );
  // ... verify INFO, WARN, ERROR too
});
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **Logger interface stays clean** - No `pingLog()` method added
- ✅ **Appropriate log level** - DEBUG for diagnostic/initialization messages
- ✅ **Immediate feedback** - `setLogger()` confirms channel works right away
- ✅ **No feature coupling** - `pingLog()` just exercises existing interface
- ✅ **Tests verify binding** - Extension tests can confirm core → outputChannel works
- ✅ **Production-friendly** - DEBUG can be filtered in production

**Usage:**

```typescript
// Extension activation (automatic verification)
outputChannel = vscode.window.createOutputChannel('RangeLink');
setLogger(new VSCodeLogger(outputChannel));
// ← Logger automatically logs "Logger initialized" via debug()

// Tests (manual verification)
pingLog(); // Exercises all 4 levels
// Observe outputChannel for "Ping for DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR" messages
```

**Files Modified:**

- `packages/rangelink-core-ts/src/logging/Logger.ts` - Add debug() method
- `packages/rangelink-core-ts/src/logging/LogManager.ts` - Call debug() in setLogger()
- `packages/rangelink-core-ts/src/logging/pingLog.ts` - New standalone function
- `packages/rangelink-vscode-extension/src/VSCodeLogger.ts` - Implement debug()
- `packages/rangelink-vscode-extension/src/__tests__/extension.test.ts` - Test pingLog()

**Done when:**

- `debug()` method added to Logger interface
- `setLogger()` calls `debug()` to confirm initialization
- `pingLog()` standalone function created and exported
- VSCodeLogger implements debug()
- Tests verify communication channel using pingLog()
- All tests pass

## Phase 4.6: Go-To-Market Readiness — 📋 High Priority

Critical items for marketplace launch and user adoption. These should be tackled soon to improve user experience and reduce friction.

### 4.6A) Keybinding Conflict Detection — 🪦 Abandoned

**Status:** Abandoned due to fundamental VSCode API limitations.

**Why abandoned:** VSCode does not expose APIs to programmatically detect keybinding conflicts. GitHub issue #162433 requesting this capability was closed as "not planned". Implementation would show warnings without actual detection, creating noise rather than value.

**See:** [CEMETERY.md](./CEMETERY.md#phase-46a-keybinding-conflict-awareness-notification-abandoned-2025-01-04) for full implementation, rationale, and lessons learned.

**Alternative:** Document keybinding conflicts in README with manual resolution steps.

---

### 4.6B) Cross-File Context Positioning — ✅ Complete

**Goal:** Highlight RangeLink's cross-file context advantage vs built-in claude-code extension.

**Problem:** Built-in claude-code extension only supports single selection from current file. RangeLink lets you generate multiple links from different files and paste all in one prompt for richer context.

**What was done:**

**VSCode Extension README:**

- Added: "🔗 **Cross-file context** — Generate links from multiple files, paste all in one prompt. Built-in claude-code: single selection, current file only."

**Root README:**

- Updated: "🤖 **AI assistants** — Multi-file context in one prompt. Generate RangeLinks from auth.ts, tests.ts, config.ts — paste all. Built-in claude-code: single selection, current file only."

**Messaging:** Direct comparison with practical workflow example. Technical, concise, no fluff.

---

## Phase 5: Terminal Link Navigation — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Make RangeLinks in terminal output clickable (Cmd+Click to navigate)

**Total Time:** ~4.5 hours (1 prerequisite + 7 micro-iterations)

**Why This Matters:** Completes the AI workflow loop:

1. Generate link → Terminal binding sends to claude-code
2. claude-code responds with code reference
3. **Click link in terminal → Jump to code** ← THIS

---

### Iteration 1: Link Parser (PREREQUISITE - 1.5h)

**Status:** ❌ No parsing code exists in codebase

**Build:** `packages/rangelink-core-ts/src/parsing/parseLink.ts`

**What it does:**

```typescript
// Input: "src/auth.ts#L42C10-L58C25"
// Output: {
//   path: "src/auth.ts",
//   start: { line: 42, char: 10 },
//   end: { line: 58, char: 25 },
//   linkType: 'Regular'
// }
```

**Formats to support:**

- `#L10` (single line)
- `#L10-L20` (multi-line)
- `#L10C5-L20C10` (with columns)
- `##L10C5-L20C10` (rectangular)

**NOT in scope:** BYOD parsing (defer to later)

**Done when:** Parser has 100% test coverage for all non-BYOD formats

**Status:** ✅ Complete (163 tests pass, 100% coverage on parseLink.ts)

---

### Iteration 1.1: Structured Error Codes for Parsing (30 min) — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Replace string error messages with RangeLinkMessageCode enum for consistency and future i18n support.

**Current issue:** Parser returns `Result<ParsedLink, string>` with hardcoded error messages like `"Link cannot be empty"`.

**What to do:**

1. Add parsing error codes to `RangeLinkMessageCode` (4xxx range):

```typescript
// Add to src/types/RangeLinkMessageCode.ts
export enum RangeLinkMessageCode {
  // ... existing codes ...

  // Parsing errors (4xxx)
  PARSE_ERR_EMPTY_LINK = 'ERR_4001',
  PARSE_ERR_NO_HASH_SEPARATOR = 'ERR_4002',
  PARSE_ERR_EMPTY_PATH = 'ERR_4003',
  PARSE_ERR_INVALID_RANGE_FORMAT = 'ERR_4004',
  PARSE_ERR_LINE_TOO_SMALL = 'ERR_4005',
  PARSE_ERR_LINE_BACKWARD = 'ERR_4006',
  PARSE_ERR_CHAR_TOO_SMALL = 'ERR_4007',
  PARSE_ERR_CHAR_BACKWARD_SAME_LINE = 'ERR_4008',
}
```

2. Update `parseLink` signature:
   - From: `Result<ParsedLink, string>`
   - To: `Result<ParsedLink, RangeLinkMessageCode>`

3. Replace all `Err('message')` calls with `Err(RangeLinkMessageCode.PARSE_ERR_*)`

4. Update all 36 tests to check for error codes instead of strings:
   - From: `expect(error).toStrictEqual('Link cannot be empty')`
   - To: `expect(error).toStrictEqual(RangeLinkMessageCode.PARSE_ERR_EMPTY_LINK)`

**Tests:**

- All existing tests should pass with enum-based assertions
- Coverage remains 100%

**Done when:**

- All parsing errors use RangeLinkMessageCode
- Tests validate error codes (not strings)
- 100% test coverage maintained

---

### Iteration 1.2: Richer ParsedLink Interface (30 min) — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Return full metadata to match FormattedLink structure (symmetry between generation and parsing).

**Current limitation:** `ParsedLink` only returns path, start/end positions, and linkType. Missing delimiter config, range format, selection type, computed selection.

**What to do:**

1. Create enhanced `ParsedLink` interface:

```typescript
export interface ParsedLink {
  /**
   * File path extracted from link
   */
  path: string;

  /**
   * Delimiter configuration used/detected in the link
   */
  delimiters: DelimiterConfig;

  /**
   * Computed selection with normalized coordinates
   */
  computedSelection: ComputedSelection;

  /**
   * Range format detected (LineOnly or WithPositions)
   */
  rangeFormat: RangeFormat;

  /**
   * Selection type (Normal or Rectangular)
   */
  selectionType: SelectionType;

  /**
   * Link type (Regular or Portable)
   */
  linkType: LinkType;
}
```

2. Update `parseLink` to construct `ComputedSelection`:

```typescript
const computedSelection: ComputedSelection = {
  startLine: startLine,
  endLine: endLine,
  startPosition: startChar,
  endPosition: endChar,
  rangeFormat: startChar !== undefined ? RangeFormat.WithPositions : RangeFormat.LineOnly,
  selectionType: linkType === 'Rectangular' ? SelectionType.Rectangular : SelectionType.Normal,
};
```

3. Update all tests to expect richer interface

**Benefits:**

- Symmetry with `FormattedLink` (generation ↔ parsing)
- Enables round-trip testing (generate → parse → generate)
- Provides full context for navigation and validation

**Done when:**

- `ParsedLink` includes all metadata fields
- Tests validate complete parsed structure
- 100% coverage maintained

---

### Iteration 1.3: DelimiterConfig Support (1 hour) — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Accept DelimiterConfig parameter to parse links with custom delimiters.

**Current limitation:** Parser hardcodes `#`, `L`, `C`, `-` delimiters.

**What to do:**

1. Add `delimiters` parameter to `parseLink`:

```typescript
export const parseLink = (
  link: string,
  delimiters: DelimiterConfig = DEFAULT_DELIMITERS,
): Result<ParsedLink, RangeLinkMessageCode> => {
  // Use delimiters.hash, delimiters.line, delimiters.position, delimiters.range
};
```

2. Update regex pattern to use delimiter config:
   - Extract path using `delimiters.hash` (single or multi-char)
   - Detect rectangular mode: `delimiters.hash` repeated twice
   - Parse range using `delimiters.line`, `delimiters.position`, `delimiters.range`

3. Example with custom delimiters:

```typescript
const customDelimiters = { hash: '@', line: 'line', position: 'col', range: '..' };
parseLink('file.ts@line10col5..line20col10', customDelimiters);
// Should parse correctly
```

**Key challenges:**

- Multi-character delimiter support (e.g., `hash: "##"` for regular links)
- Regex escaping for special characters
- Rectangular mode detection with custom hash delimiter

**Tests:**

- Parse with default delimiters (existing tests pass)
- Parse with single-character custom delimiters
- Parse with multi-character custom delimiters
- Rectangular mode with custom hash delimiter
- Edge case: `delimHash="#"` regular vs `delimHash="##"` (rectangular uses 4 hashes)

**Done when:**

- Parser accepts optional `DelimiterConfig` parameter
- All delimiter characters are configurable
- Tests cover default and custom delimiter scenarios
- 100% coverage maintained

---

### Iteration 1.4: Round-Trip Integration Tests (1 hour) — 📋 Planned

**Goal:** Verify parsing and generation are inverses of each other (round-trip integrity).

**What to do:**

1. Create `src/__tests__/integration/roundTrip.test.ts`:

```typescript
describe('Round-trip integration', () => {
  describe('Generate → Parse → Generate', () => {
    it('should produce identical link for single-line selection', () => {
      const inputSelection: InputSelection = {
        selections: [
          {
            startLine: 10,
            startCharacter: 0,
            endLine: 10,
            endCharacter: 0,
            coverage: SelectionCoverage.FullLine,
          },
        ],
        selectionType: SelectionType.Normal,
      };

      // Generate
      const formatted = formatLink('src/file.ts', inputSelection, DEFAULT_DELIMITERS);
      expect(formatted.success).toBe(true);
      const originalLink = formatted.value.link;

      // Parse
      const parsed = parseLink(originalLink, DEFAULT_DELIMITERS);
      expect(parsed.success).toBe(true);

      // Regenerate from parsed data
      const regenerated = formatLink(
        parsed.value.path,
        toInputSelection(parsed.value.computedSelection),
        parsed.value.delimiters,
      );

      expect(regenerated.value.link).toStrictEqual(originalLink);
    });
  });

  describe('Parse → Generate → Parse', () => {
    it('should produce identical parsed structure', () => {
      const originalLink = 'src/auth.ts#L42C10-L58C25';

      // Parse
      const parsed1 = parseLink(originalLink);
      expect(parsed1.success).toBe(true);

      // Generate
      const formatted = formatLink(
        parsed1.value.path,
        toInputSelection(parsed1.value.computedSelection),
        parsed1.value.delimiters,
      );

      // Re-parse
      const parsed2 = parseLink(formatted.value.link);

      expect(parsed2.value).toStrictEqual(parsed1.value);
    });
  });
});
```

2. Test all formats:
   - Single-line (`#L10`)
   - Multi-line (`#L10-L20`)
   - With columns (`#L10C5-L20C10`)
   - Rectangular (`##L10C5-L20C10`)
   - Custom delimiters
   - BYOD links (when supported)

3. Create helper: `toInputSelection(computedSelection: ComputedSelection): InputSelection`

**Edge cases to test:**

- Line-only vs with-positions round-trip
- Rectangular mode preservation
- Custom delimiter round-trip
- Zero-indexed to one-indexed conversion correctness

**Done when:**

- Generate → Parse → Generate preserves original link
- Parse → Generate → Parse preserves parsed structure
- All link formats tested
- Custom delimiters tested
- Tests pass with 100% reliability

---

### Iteration 3.1: Pattern Detection (30 min)

**File:** `packages/rangelink-vscode-extension/src/navigation/patterns.ts`

**What:** Create regex patterns to detect RangeLinks in terminal output

**Key challenge:** Distinguish RangeLinks from GitHub URLs

**Solution:**

```typescript
// RangeLink: starts with ./ or / or word chars (no protocol)
// GitHub URL: starts with http:// or https://
const rangeLinkPattern = /(?<!https?:\/\/[^\s]*)([\w\./\\-]+\.[\w]+)(#{1,2})L\d+/g;
```

**Tests:**

- ✅ Matches valid RangeLinks
- ✅ Ignores GitHub URLs
- ✅ Handles workspace-relative paths (`./src/file.ts`)
- ✅ Handles absolute paths (`/Users/name/project/file.ts`)
- ✅ Detects rectangular mode (`##`)

**Done when:** Pattern detection has 100% test coverage

---

### Iteration 3.2: Terminal Link Provider Registration (20 min)

**File:** `packages/rangelink-vscode-extension/src/navigation/TerminalLinkProvider.ts`

**What:** Minimal provider that detects links but doesn't navigate yet

**Implementation:**

```typescript
export class RangeLinkTerminalProvider implements vscode.TerminalLinkProvider {
  provideTerminalLinks(
    context: vscode.TerminalLinkContext,
    token: vscode.CancellationToken,
  ): vscode.ProviderResult<RangeLinkTerminalLink[]> {
    const line = context.line;
    const matches = detectRangeLinkPatterns(line); // From 3.1

    return matches.map((match) => ({
      startIndex: match.start,
      length: match.end - match.start,
      tooltip: 'Open in editor',
      data: match.text, // Full link text
    }));
  }

  handleTerminalLink(link: RangeLinkTerminalLink): void {
    // Log for now - navigation comes in 3.4
    getLogger().info({ link: link.data }, 'Terminal link clicked');
    vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Clicked: ${link.data}`);
  }
}
```

**Register in `extension.ts`:**

```typescript
context.subscriptions.push(
  vscode.window.registerTerminalLinkProvider(new RangeLinkTerminalProvider()),
);
```

**Done when:**

- Links appear in terminal (underlined/hoverable)
- Click shows info message
- No navigation yet (that's next!)

---

### Iteration 3.3: Path Resolution (30 min)

**File:** `packages/rangelink-vscode-extension/src/navigation/pathResolver.ts`

**What:** Given a path from link, resolve to actual file URI

**Complexity:**

- Workspace-relative: `src/file.ts` → `/Users/name/project/src/file.ts`
- Already absolute: `/Users/name/project/src/file.ts` → use as-is
- Multi-folder workspace: which folder?
- File doesn't exist: error handling

**Tests:**

- ✅ Absolute paths resolve correctly
- ✅ Workspace-relative paths resolve
- ✅ Multi-folder workspace (tries each)
- ✅ File not found returns null
- ✅ No workspace open returns null

**Done when:** Path resolution works for all scenarios with tests

---

### Iteration 3.4: Basic Navigation (Single Line) (20 min)

**File:** Update `TerminalLinkProvider.handleTerminalLink()`

**What:** Navigate to file and select range (single-line only for now)

**Tests:**

- ✅ Opens file
- ✅ Selects correct line
- ✅ Reveals in viewport
- ✅ Error handling (file not found, invalid link)

**Done when:** Can click `src/file.ts#L10` and jump to line 10

---

### Iteration 3.5: Multi-Line & Column Precision (20 min)

**What:** Support multi-line ranges and column precision

**Tests:**

- ✅ `#L10-L20` selects lines 10-20
- ✅ `#L10C5-L20C15` selects with column precision
- ✅ `#L10` selects single line
- ✅ Edge cases (end of file, long lines)

**Done when:** All link formats navigate correctly (except rectangular)

---

### Iteration 3.6: Rectangular Mode Support (30 min)

**What:** Detect double hash, create multiple cursors for rectangular selection

**Challenge:** VSCode doesn't have native "rectangular selection" API. Need to create multiple cursors.

**Tests:**

- ✅ `##L10C5-L20C10` creates multi-cursor
- ✅ Each line selected from column 5 to 10
- ✅ Viewport shows first selection

**Done when:** Rectangular links create proper multi-cursor selection

---

### Iteration 3.7: Error Handling & Polish (20 min)

**What:** Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

**Error scenarios:**

1. File not found
2. Invalid link format
3. Line out of range (clamp to document bounds)
4. Column out of range (clamp to line length)

**Logging:**

- All navigation attempts (success/failure)
- User actions (which links clicked)
- Performance (time to open file)

**Done when:**

- Robust error handling
- Clear user feedback
- Comprehensive logging

---

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**

- Pattern detection (3.1)
- Path resolution (3.3)
- Selection creation logic

**Integration Tests:**

- Mock terminal context
- Mock file system
- Verify end-to-end flow

**Manual Testing Checklist:**

- [ ] Generate link with terminal binding
- [ ] claude-code prints link in response
- [ ] Link is underlined/hoverable
- [ ] Cmd+Click navigates to correct location
- [ ] Works with relative paths
- [ ] Works with absolute paths
- [ ] Works with multi-line ranges
- [ ] Works with column precision
- [ ] Works with rectangular mode
- [ ] Error messages are clear
- [ ] File not found handled gracefully

---

### Feature Creep Prevention 🚧

**NOT in these iterations:**

❌ BYOD link parsing (defer to Phase 1C)
❌ Link preview on hover (future enhancement)
❌ Configurable link patterns (future enhancement)
❌ History of clicked links (cemetery resident - see [CEMETERY.md](./CEMETERY.md))
❌ Link validation before navigation (nice-to-have)

**Stay focused:** Detect → Parse → Resolve → Navigate. That's it.

---

### Deliverable

After these 8 iterations (1 prerequisite + 7 terminal link provider):

✅ **Clickable terminal links** for RangeLink output
✅ **Full format support** (single-line, multi-line, columns, rectangular)
✅ **Robust error handling** (file not found, invalid format, etc.)
✅ **Comprehensive tests** (unit + integration)
✅ **AI workflow complete** (generate → send → click → navigate)

**This is the killer feature** that makes RangeLink competitive with Cursor's AI integration.

## Phase 7: Productivity Features

### Strategic Context: AI-First Development Workflow

**RangeLink's Primary Value Proposition:**

RangeLink is an **AI workflow integration tool** that eliminates context-sharing friction for developers using external AI assistants (claude-code, ChatGPT, Gemini). While link sharing and team collaboration are valuable secondary use cases, the primary driver is **high-frequency AI context feeding**.

**Why AI-First Matters:**

- **Workflow frequency:** Generating links for AI happens 50-100+ times per day (vs. sharing with teammates 5-10 times)
- **Friction compounds:** 2-second manual paste × 100 times/day = 200+ context switches eliminated
- **Competitive positioning:** Cursor's killer feature is integrated AI with automatic context. RangeLink makes external AI assistants feel just as integrated while preserving:
  - Choice of AI model (Claude, GPT, Gemini, local models)
  - Full control over context granularity (precise ranges, not full files)
  - Editor independence (works in VSCode, Cursor, Sublime, etc.)

**Feature Priority Implications:**

- **Bind to Terminal** is the killer feature (not "nice-to-have")
- **Link History** amplifies terminal binding by enabling reference reuse
- **Precision and portability** enable AI accuracy (AI gets exactly what you meant)
- **Navigation features** are secondary (AI already "navigates" when reading links)
- **Marketing narrative:** Position as "AI tooling extension" first, "code reference utility" second

**Post-Launch Messaging Strategy:**

After implementing Bind to Terminal MVP (Iterations 1-3), update both READMEs with AI-first narrative (see draft below in this phase). This repositions RangeLink from "yet another link generator" to "essential AI development workflow tool."

### **Draft README Messaging (Post Terminal Binding Implementation)**

**Hero Section Bullet Points:**

```markdown
- ⚡ **Zero-friction AI context** — Bind to your claude-code terminal. Links appear instantly, no copy/paste.
- 🎯 **Precise references** — Line ranges, columns, rectangular selections. AI gets exactly what you meant.
- 🔗 **Universal compatibility** — Paste into terminals, chat apps, comments, PRs, anywhere text works
```

**New Section: "Why RangeLink?"**

```markdown
## Why RangeLink?

### For AI-Assisted Development

Using claude-code or ChatGPT for development? RangeLink eliminates the context-sharing friction:

1. **Select code** → Generate link (Cmd+R Cmd+L)
2. **Bind to integrated terminal** → Link appears in claude-code instantly (within VSCode/Cursor)
3. **AI reads precise context** → No manual copy/paste, no lost focus

**Compete with Cursor's built-in AI** by making external AI assistants feel integrated. You get:

- Choice of AI model (Claude, GPT, Gemini)
- Full control over context (precise line ranges, not full files)
- Works across editors (VSCode, Cursor, Sublime)

### Workflow Demo

---

- [x] **Bind to Terminal** - ✅ MVP Complete (Iterations 1-2)
  - **Problem:** Manual workflow friction - After generating a link for claude-code (running in terminal), user must manually paste it from clipboard
  - **Solution:** Automatically paste generated links into a designated terminal, enabling seamless workflow
  - **Primary Use Case:** Running claude-code in VS Code/Cursor terminal - link generation automatically pastes into active claude-code session
  - **Behavior:** Copy to clipboard AND paste to terminal (both operations)
  - **Scope:** All link generation commands (selection, file, symbol, portable)
  - **Platform:** Works in VS Code and Cursor

  **✅ MVP (Iteration 1): Terminal Binding** (Completed)
  - Add command: "RangeLink: Bind to Terminal"
  - **Binding behavior:** Captures the terminal that is active when command is executed - this becomes the bound terminal
  - All subsequent link generation sends to the BOUND terminal (not "whichever terminal is active at send time")
  - Send using `terminal.sendText(link, false)` (no auto-submit - user presses Enter manually)
  - Store terminal reference in memory (session-scoped, not persisted)
  - Status bar feedback: "Bound: [terminal-name]"
  - Command to disable: "RangeLink: Unbind Terminal"
  - **Binding constraint:** If already bound, shows error toast requiring explicit unbind first
  - **Edge case:** If no terminal is active when binding, show error: "No active terminal. Open a terminal and try again."
  - **Done when:** Can bind/unbind terminal, links send to BOUND terminal consistently, status bar shows confirmation

  **✅ Iteration 2: Terminal Lifecycle Management** (Completed)
  - Listen to `window.onDidCloseTerminal` event
  - Auto-unbind when bound terminal closes
  - Show status bar message: "Terminal binding removed (terminal closed)"
  - Log terminal closure event
  - Clear stored terminal reference
  - Comprehensive logging for all bind/unbind/send operations via getLogger()
  - **Done when:** Feature auto-unbinds on terminal closure with user feedback

  **📋 Iteration 3: Enhanced Rebinding UX** (0.5h) - Low Priority
  - **Current limitation:** If already bound, bind command shows error toast requiring manual unbind
  - **Improvement:** Allow seamless rebinding without manual unbind
  - When bind command is invoked while already bound:
    - Show information toast: "Already bound to [current-terminal]. Switch to [new-terminal]?"
    - Two buttons: "Switch" and "Cancel"
    - If "Switch" clicked, perform rebinding automatically
    - Log: `Rebinding from [old] to [new]`
  - Alternative UX: Silent rebinding with info toast "Rebound: [old] → [new]"
  - **Done when:** User can rebind without explicit unbind, with clear feedback about the change

  **📋 Iteration 4: Persistent Status Bar Indicator** (1h) - Low Priority
  - Add persistent status bar item showing current binding state
  - Icon and text: `🔗→ [terminal-name]` when bound, `🔗❌` when unbound
  - Status bar item tooltip: "RangeLink bound to terminal: [name]. Click to rebind."
  - Click behavior:
    - When bound: Shows Quick Pick to switch terminals (or unbind option)
    - When unbound: Runs bind command
  - Registered with extension context for proper cleanup
  - **Done when:** User has persistent visual indicator of binding state, can click to manage binding

  **📋 Iteration 5: Terminal Selection with Quick Pick** (2h)
  - Enhance bind command to show Quick Pick menu of available terminals
  - Display terminal info: name, position/index in list, process name
  - Handle terminals with duplicate names: Show "zsh (1)", "zsh (2)" with indices
  - Allow user to select which terminal to bind to
  - Preview format: `[1] zsh - /Users/username/project`
  - **Re-binding behavior:** If already bound, show Quick Pick to switch to different terminal (no need to unbind first)
  - Confirmation message: "Binding switched from [old-terminal] to [new-terminal]"
  - **Edge case:** If only one terminal exists, auto-select it (skip Quick Pick UI)
  - **Done when:** User can pick specific terminal from list, can re-bind without unbinding, handles edge cases gracefully

  **📋 Iteration 6: Context Menu Integration** (1h)
  - Add "Bind RangeLink Here" to terminal tab context menu
  - Right-click on terminal name in terminal list to bind
  - Show checkmark indicator when terminal is the active binding target
  - **Done when:** Can bind via right-click on terminal, visual indicator shows bound terminal

  **Future Iterations (Defer):**
  - Visual indicator in terminal list (logo/icon next to bound terminal name) - VS Code API research needed
  - Persist terminal binding across sessions (complex: terminal IDs change on restart)
    - Potential approach: Store terminal name + cwd, attempt to match on startup
    - Show notification if stored terminal no longer exists: "Previously bound terminal not found. Bind again?"
  - Multi-terminal support: Bind different link types to different terminals
    - Example: Portable links → Terminal 1, Regular links → Terminal 2
  - Keyboard shortcut for quick toggle: `Cmd+R Cmd+T` / `Ctrl+R Ctrl+T` to bind/unbind
  - Settings integration:
    - `rangelink.terminalBinding.enabled`: Enable binding by default on startup
    - `rangelink.terminalBinding.defaultTerminal`: "active" | "first" | "last" | terminal name pattern
    - `rangelink.terminalBinding.showStatusBarItem`: Show persistent indicator (default: true)
  - Terminal profile integration: Auto-bind for specific terminal profiles (e.g., "claude-code")
  - Fallback to clipboard-only with graceful error handling improvements
  - Support for remote terminals (VS Code Remote Development)
  - Smart detection: If clipboard contains claude-code prompt, suggest enabling terminal binding

  **Technical Notes:**
  - VS Code Terminal API: `window.activeTerminal`, `window.terminals`
  - Terminal identification: `terminal.name` (user-facing), `terminal.processId` (unreliable across sessions)
  - Position tracking: Array index in `window.terminals` (reliable during session, changes on close)
  - Status bar API: `window.createStatusBarItem()` with `command` for click handling

  **Error Handling:**
  - Terminal closed: Auto-disable with status bar notification
  - No active terminal when enabling: Show error toast, guide to command palette
  - Terminal unavailable during paste: Show warning toast, clipboard still contains link
  - Multiple windows open: Feature scoped to window (VS Code window.terminals is window-specific)

- [ ] **Link History with Fuzzy Search** (High Priority for AI Workflow)
  - **Problem:** Need to reference previously shared code locations without regenerating links
  - **AI Workflow Use Case:** "What was that auth function I showed claude-code 2 hours ago?"
  - **Solution:** Searchable history with quick re-send to bound terminal

  **Iteration 1: Basic History Storage** (1.5h)
  - Store last 100 generated links in workspace state
  - Track: link, timestamp, file path, range description
  - Command: "RangeLink: Show Link History"
  - Display in Quick Pick: `[2h ago] src/auth.ts:42-56 (login validation)`
  - Copy selected link to clipboard
  - **Done when:** Can view and copy from history

  **Iteration 2: Fuzzy Search** (2h)
  - Integrate fuzzy search library (fzy, fuse.js, or VSCode's built-in)
  - Search across: file names, paths, range descriptions, timestamps
  - Quick Pick with real-time filtering as you type
  - Show match highlights in results
  - Keyboard shortcuts: Up/Down to navigate, Enter to copy
  - **Done when:** Can type "auth log" and instantly find relevant links

  **Iteration 3: Quick Re-Send to Bound Terminal** (1h)
  - If terminal binding is active, add "Send to Terminal" action in history Quick Pick
  - Keyboard shortcut in history view: `Cmd+Enter` to send (vs `Enter` to copy)
  - Status bar feedback: "Link re-sent to [terminal-name]"
  - **Use case:** "Let me show claude-code that auth function again" → search → Cmd+Enter → done
  - **Done when:** Can re-send historical links without leaving history UI

  **Iteration 4: Smart Context Descriptions** (1.5h)
  - Auto-generate human-readable descriptions from code
  - Extract function/class names, variable declarations from selected ranges
  - Example: `src/auth.ts:42-56` → `validateLogin function (src/auth.ts:42-56)`
  - Fallback to first line of code if no clear symbol
  - Allow manual description override in history view
  - **Done when:** History is scannable without memorizing line numbers

  **Iteration 5: History Management** (1h)
  - Export history as markdown (for documentation/notes)
  - Export as CSV (for analysis/reporting)
  - Clear history command
  - Configurable history size (default: 100, max: 500)
  - Setting: `rangelink.history.enabled` (opt-out for privacy)
  - **Done when:** Can manage history, export for external use

  **Future Enhancements:**
  - Sync history across devices (VSCode Settings Sync)
