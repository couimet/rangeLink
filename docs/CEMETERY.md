# The Feature Cemetery 🪦

*"Where good ideas come to rest in peace"*

> Looking for a feature you can't find in the [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md)? It might be here. We honor these fallen friends — rejected not from cruelty, but from wisdom.

## Link History / Recent Links

**Born:** 2025-01-03
**Died:** 2025-01-03 (lived 30 minutes)
**Cause of Death:** Redundancy

### Epitaph

*"I wanted to remember your links, but Alfred already does."*

### The Dream

A command to show recently generated RangeLinks with:
- Quick pick with fuzzy search
- Last 10-20 links
- Select to copy or resend to terminal
- Perfect for iterative AI conversations

### Why It Failed

OS-level clipboard managers already do this **better**:
- ✅ Universal clipboard history (not just RangeLinks)
- ✅ Fuzzy search that Actually Works™
- ✅ Sync across devices
- ✅ Export/import
- ✅ Categories and favorites
- ✅ Users already have them installed

**What would RangeLink add?** Context about which file/when? Too niche. Users won't switch from their battle-tested clipboard manager for one app's specific links.

### The Lesson

**Don't compete with OS-level tools that do one thing exceptionally well.**

Instead, focus on what only RangeLink can do: seamless editor ↔ terminal integration for AI workflows.

### Where The Energy Went Instead

→ **Terminal Link Provider** (click links in claude-code output)
→ **Terminal Binding** (auto-send links to AI)
→ **Link Navigation** (click to jump to code)

These features create unique value that clipboard managers can't provide.

## Future Residents

*This cemetery is open for new arrivals. Features are admitted by committee decision, usually after a vigorous debate and several cups of coffee.*

*To nominate a feature for eternal rest, open an issue with the tag `cemetery-candidate`.*
